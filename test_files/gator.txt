Ok, you may think this is a rather stupid thing or you probably don't
belive that ist's possible, but hey I did it, so Fuck You non believers.
To start, start to excersise or get your heart beat going at a nice little
rate. So that your blood gets crusing in your veins. You dont need to break
a sweat or anything, just get the blood moving a little bit. Second go out
and buy some of the 1 quart size, powdered gatorade packets. And get a
container equal to one quart. Now, Put 2 1/2 - 3 bags in it, Or ya can put
4 in for a massive trip, but ya may be totaly bummed out after the trip!
Is your heart still going quick? So, if it is, drink as much as posible, and
go back to excersising. In just a little while you'll start to get a little
hyper. Go and drink some more now, After another short amount of time you'll
be in space almost and you'll start to do crazy things that you wouldn't
normally do. I strongly suggest that you don't do this when your in a bad
mood or depressed, you'll just end up feeling worse. What is really going
on is... You now have a huge SUGAR count in your system. I wouldn't suggest
doing this if your over 30 years old, or aren't an active teen ager. The
best time to do it is when your in a very good mood, try it at a party
when your really horny, you'll be supprised at the things you have done.
Well, Thats about it for now.
