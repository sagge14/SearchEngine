      Evocation Of Faunus
      -------------------
All wild creatures hear thy cry
upon the haunted wind.
Within thy soul the Horned One
returns to Earth again.
Together thou shalt maifest
the magick of the man,
And falcons soar from out the sky
to perch upon thy hand.
The Serpent's wisdom thou shalt learn
from tip of forked tongue;
The fleetness of the white stag's flight
in starlight or in sun.


Lord of Light and Lord of Shadow --
Keeper of the Key
Which unlocks the Door of Dream
whereby men come from to thee.
Cernunnos, Tane, Horus, Pan:
by name we set thee free!
Oh Shephard of the Wild Woodland
may thou be One with He.
