DUKE HAS A DREAM by Jane Rein'l
(to the tune of "White Christmas")
 
I'm dreaming of a white nation
Just like the one we used to know
With the blacks polite folks
And all us white folks
Ushered into the front row.
 
I've left behind the Klan and Nazis.
Now no-more-quotas is my thing.
Welfare queens, you've had your last fling,
And a Duke still ranks above a King.
 
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR LOVING ME by Tom
            Rogers (to the tune of That's
            What You Get for Loving Me)
 
Chorus (by Gennifer, Ty and Annette)
 
That's what you get for loving me
That's what you get for loving me
Your presidential hopes are gone,
As you can see
That's what you get for loving me.
 
Gennifer:
 
You thought I'd kiss and never tell.
But then the "Star," it paid real well
My face was on the "Star" and in
"Time" magazine
For a little more cash, the rest can be seen
 
Ty:
 
You made the "Star" and "Current Affair"
You kept your clothes but I went bare
From beauty queen to centerfold
--a "Playboy" spread
But Senator Robb's career is dead
 
Annette:
 
I really am fun on a official planes
Escorting Symington's  my game
No habla Espanol at all or Japanese
But as your trade rep I am E-Z
 
That's what you get for loving me
That's what you get for loving me
You're presidential hopes are gone,
As you can see
That's what you get for loving me
