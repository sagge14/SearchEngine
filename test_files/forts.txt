      The Joy of Fortifications
    (To the tune "Cats on the Rooftop").

When You wake up in the morning,
     And your castle's under siege
Your troops are on the walls
     And they're looking to their liege
Better close up your portcullis
     'Fore the barbican they seize
As you contemplate the joy of fortifications

(Chorus)

     Knights on the guardwalk,
          Knights in the towers
     Knights who are batchelors comtemplating dowers
          Knights in their armour of authority and power
     As they contemplate the joy of fortifications

If on the field of battle,
     In defeat you have to run
You'll find no cause for worry
     If your home is made of stone
You can taunt 'em from the crenels
     Up until your day is done
As you contemplate the joy of fortifications

(Chorus)

Catapults and trebuchets
     may cause you some concern
With the proper use of fire
     most contraptions you can burn
You'll surely have to sally forth
     Before you get your turn
As you contemplate the joy of fortifications

(Chorus)

Stone offers you safety,
     All throughout the year
It's a place to spend your taxes,
     As your peasants quake in fear
It's a place to keep you comfy
     For a "Droit de Seigneur"
As you contemplate the joy of fortifications

(Chorus)

Now if your safe security,
     Your neighbours do abuse
Perchance you may avail yorself
     Your neighbours to amuse
Laying siege around their castle
     Its an act you can't refuse
As they contemplate the joy of fortifications

(Chorus)
