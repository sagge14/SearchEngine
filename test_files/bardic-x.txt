             ABDUL EL BULBUL, EMIR!
                         -Anonymous

     In the harems of Egypt it's good to behold
     The fairest of harlots appear,
     But the fairest, a Greek
     Was owned by a sheik
     Named Abdul el Bulbul Emir!

     A traveling brothel came into the town
     Run by a pimp from afar
     Whose great reputation 
     Had traveled the nation:
     'Twas Ivan Skidavitsky Skavar!

     Abdul the Bulbul arrived with his bride
     A prize whose eyes shone like a star
     He claimed he could prong
     More cunts with his dong
     Than Ivan Skidavitsky Skavar!

     A day was arranged for the spectacle great;
     A visit was planned by the Czar!
     And the curbs were all lined
     With harlots reclined
     In honour of Ivan Skavar!

     They met on the track with their tools hanging slack
     Dressed only in shoes and a leer,
     Both were fast on the rise
     but folks gasped at the size
     Of Abdul el Bulbul Emir!

     The cunts were all shorn, and no rubbers adorned
     The prongs of the pimp and the peer,
     But the pimp's steady stroke
     Soon left without hope
     The chance of the Bulbul Emir!

     They worked thru the night til the dawn's early light
     The clamor was heard from afar
     The multitudes came 
     To applaud the ball game
     Of Abdul and Ivan Skavar!

     When Ivan had finished, he turned to the Greek,
     And laughed when she shivered in fear
     She swallowed his pride, 
     He buggered the bride
     Of Abdul el Bulbul, Emir!

Abdul El Bulbul Emir (cont.)

     When Ivan was done, and was wiping his gun,
     He bent down to polish his gear;
     He felt, up his ass,
     A hard pecker pass;
     'Twas Abdul el Bulbul, Emir!           

     The crowd loudly howled that it was a foul,
     They were ordered to part, by the Czar,
     But fast they were jammed;
     The pecker was crammed
     In Ivan Skidavitsky Skavar!

     Now, the cream of the joke, when apart they were broke,
     Was laughed at for years by the Czar:
     For Abdul the Bulbul
     Left most of his tool
     In Ivan Skidavitsky Skavar!

     The fair Grecian maiden a sad vigil keeps
     With a husband whose tastes have turned queer...
     She longs for the dong
     That once did belong
     To Abdul el Bulbul, Emir!

                  AGAINST ALL FLAGS
                  (Tune: "Girl I Left Behind Me")

  Oh, the SCA is the kind of play
  That spodes all get their kicks on
  And Pennsic War is the kind of bore
  That the peoples can get sicks on!
  And I'd like to sod the Goddam BoD
  With a dildo made of brass on,
  And your Kingdom Flag is the kind of rag
  That a Mongol wipes his ass on!

  Oh the Chivalry are very "twee,"
  And the Laurels don't do nothin'.
  And the Pelican fags are all on the rag;
  In an uproar about somethin'.
  For the King and Queen are seldom seen,
  With their Goddam cute brass hats on,
  And your Kingdom Flag is the kind of a rag
  That a Mongol wipes his ass on!

  Oh the Great Dark Horde doesn't have a sword
  That's worth a wooden firkin
  And the Moritu don't know what to do
  But sit and jerk their gherkin!
  And the Tuchux upchuck woodchuck guts
  At the Royal's brass-ass hats on,
  And the Mongol flag is the kind of a rag
  That the Kingdom wipes it's ass on!

          ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE!
                (from "The Life Of Brian" (Monty Python)

    Cheer up, Brian. You know what they say.
    Some things in life are bad
    They can really make you mad
    Other things just make you swear and curse
    When you're chewing on life's gristle
    Don't grumble, give a whistle
    And this'll help things turn out for the best...
    And......always look on the bright side of life
     (whistle)
    Always look on the bright side of life...
     (whistle)

    If life seems jolly rotten
    There's something you've forgotten
    And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing,
    When you're feeling in the dumps,
    Don't be silly chumps
    Just purse your lips and whistle--that's the thing.

    And...always look on the bright side of life...
     (whistle)
    Always look on the right side of life...
     (whistle)

    For life is quite absurd
    And death's the final word
    You must always face the curtain with a bow
    Forget about your sin--give the audiences a grin
    Enjoy it--it's your last chance anyhow.
    So always look on the bright side of death
    Just before you draw your terminal breath

    Life's a piece of shit
    When you look at it
    Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true,
    You'll see it's all a show,
    Keep 'em laughing as you go
    Just remember that the last laugh is on you.

    And always look on the bright side of life...
     (whistle)
    Always look on the right side of life
     (whistle)

        THE ANCIENT AND OLD IRISH CONDOM
                              -Anonymous
        (Tune: "Rosin the Beau")
        (Recorded: "Celtic Pride: In Strange Form")

     I was up to me arse in the muck, Sir,
     with a peat contract down in the bog
     When me shovel it struck something hard, Sir,
     that I thought was a rock or a log

     T'was a box of the finest old oak, Sir,
     T'was a foot long, and four inches wide
     and not giving a damn for the Fairies
     I just took a quick look inside

     Now I opened the lid of this box, Sir,
     and I swear that my story is true
     T'was an ancient and old Irish condom
     A relic of Brian Boru

     T'was an ancient and old Irish condom
     T'was a foot long, and made of elk hide,
     With a little gold tag on it's end, Sir,
     with his name, rank, and stud fee inscribed

     Now, I cast me mind back thru the ages
     To the days of that horny old Celt
     With his wife lyin' by on the bed, Sir,
     As he stood by the fire in his pelt

     And I thought that I heard Brian whisper
     As he stood in the fire's rosy light
     "Well, you've had yer own way long enough, dear...
     'Tis the hairy side outside, tonight."

      THE BALLAD OF STARK UNBELIEF
                 -Ioseph of Locksley
                 -tune: variant on "I wish I was a busy bee"
                        or "There are no Fighter Pilots"

     (Chorus): Oh------
               Put it on the ground
               Spread it all around
               Dig it with a hoe
               It'll make your flowers grow!

     Now, peerages are given for a reason
     And that reason is simply understood:
     For Chivalry, and Honesty, and Bravery
     And being very, very, very Good!

     Awards are given out to the deserving,
     And no one EVER bitches, out of spite!
     We forget the little slights and innuendos
     And we really DO believe that Right makes Might!

     "Nepotisim" is a word we've never heard of,
     "Politics" is just a friendly little game!
     We have counted every shot that we've been given,
     And Camelot is where we always aim!

     Oh the King is up there, sitting in the Throne Room,
     And the Pelicans are sitting on the grass,
     The Knights are getting drunk and falling down (a lot),
     And the Laurels are all sitting on their...laurels! 

     The BoD is doing something I'm not sure of,        
     The Registry has lost your membership,
     The Marshallate can't find it's head with both hands and a road-map,
     And the Heralds are all full of chicken-ship!

      THE BALL OF BALLYKNURE (AKA: THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS)
               -Traditional Scots from the 1880's
               SCA verses by Ioseph of Locksley & many others
               NO responsibility for misuse is assumed!

 Oh the Ball, the Ball of Ballyknure
 Where your wife, and my wife, were doin' it on the floor!

 (chorus) Wha' do ya, lassie?
          and wha' do y'noo?
          I'm the man what did y'last, lass,
          I canna do y'noo!

 The Queen was in the parlour, eatin bread and honey
 The King was in the chambermaid, and she was in the money!

 The village idiot he was there, a-sittin' by the fire
 Attempting masturbation with an india-rubber tyre!

 Oh, the village postman he was there, but he had the Pox
 He couldna' do the ladies so he did the letter-box!

 The Queen of England she was there, backed against the wall
 "Put yer money on the table, boys, I'm going ta do you all!"

 The Count and Countess, they were there, a-doin' on the stair
 The bannister broke, and down they fell, they finished in mid-air!

 There was music in the garden, there was music in the sticks
 You couldna' hear the music for the swishin' o' the pricks!

 They were doin' it on the landing, they were doin' it on the stairs
 You couldna' see the carpet for the wealth of pubic hairs!

 The Kingdom Herald, he was there, whattya think o'that?
 Blazoning positions wi' a Duchess and a cat!

 The fubba-wubbas they were there, sittin' all alone
 Complainin of the doin's with loud and piercing moans!

 Mr. Jameison he was there, the one that fought the Boers
 He jumped up on the table and he shouted for the hoors!

 The Board of Directors they were there, and they were shocked to see
 Four-and-twenty maidenheads a-hangin' from a tree!

 John the Blacksmith he was there, he wouldna play the game
 He did a lassie seven times, but wouldna see her hame!

 The village Constable he was there, now whattya think o'that?
 Amusin' himself by abusin' himself, and catchin' it in his hat...

 It started out so simple-like: each lad and lassie mated
 But pretty soon the doin's got so bloody complicated!

 Four and twenty virgins came down from Cuinimore
 Only two got back again, and they were double-bore!

 Ball of Ballyknure (cont.)

 Clan MacChluarain, they were there, sleepin in the shade
 For no one could decide if they were Man, or Sheep, or Maid!

 The village pervert he was there, scratchin' at his crotch
 But no one minded him at all, he was only there to watch!

 The Kingdom Seneshal was there, linin' 'em up in rows
 He didna use his pecker, lads, he did 'em with his toes!

 The village cripple he was there, but he didna shag too much
 His old John Thomas had fallen off, so he did 'em with his crutch!

 The old schoolteacher he was there, he diddled by rule-of-thumb
 workin' logarithmicly the times that he would come!

 The village chimney-sweep was there, a really filthy brute
 For every time he farted, he covered 'em all with soot!

 The local Cavaliers were there, in elegance they sat
 A-doin' Things Unusual with the feathers in their hat!

 The Rapier-fighters they were there, doin' what they could
 A-thrustin' and a-parryin' with Real Steel, not with wood!

 The local Hordesmen they were there, busier than bees
 the ladies wouldna have 'em, so they diddled dogs and trees!

 The village carpenter he was there, with his prick of wood
 He made it when he lost his own, and it worked just as good!

 The shenai-fighters they were there, all wrapped up in smiles
 A-doin' everyone they could in Oriental style!

 The College of Heralds they were there, in the other room
 Arguin' about who would do what, with which, to whom!

 The rattan-jocks were out in force and they were such a sight
 They didna do the ladies 'cause they'd heard there was a fight!

 The old fishmonger he was there, a dirty stinkin sod
 He never got a rise that night, so he diddled 'em with a cod!

 The Kingdom Laurels they were there, and quite a sight to see
 A-doin' everyone they could, and most artisticly!

 The Kingdom Pelicans were there, doin' it with a sob
 They diddled out of duty; it was just another job!

 Four and twenty virgins went down to Inverness
 And when the Ball was over, there were four and twenty less!

 There was doin's on the porches, and doin's on the stones
 You couldna' hear the music for the loud and joyful moans!

 (insert name) he was there, covered up with smiles
 Doin' thirty-two at once, and in amazing style!

 Ball of Ballyknure (cont.)

 All the Kingdom spodes were there, but they just sat and sulked
 For this was the occasion that no one told them "Get fulked!"

 Clan MacChluarain they were there, chasin' round the Keep
 And every single man of them buggerin' a sheep!

 (insert name) had a gerbil, he diddled it very well
 He didn't wrap it in duct tape: he blew it all to hell!

 (insert name) he was there, with his favourite toys:
 A dozen beautiful women, and a dozen beautiful boys!

 (insert name) he was there; he wasn't very nice
 He didna do the ladies, he did gerbils, rats and mice!

 (insert name) she was there, covered all in sweat,
 Takin' on all comers, and she hasn't finished yet!

 (insert name) she was there, covered all in sweat,
 The Dark Horde carried her away, and we ain't found her yet!

 The Locksley Monsters they were there, lookin' for some nookie
 But they got distracted by a chocolate chippie cookie!

 (insert name) he was there, a crafty friend of Ghengis,
 He speaks a lot of languages; he is a cunning linguist!

 The village Masochist, he was there, beggin' for some blows
 The Sadist merely looked at him, and softly answered "No!"

 Yang the Nauseating was sittin' out in back
 The ladies did na' want him for he smelled too much of yak!

 The village druggist he was there, grinnin' like a fox
 He'd sold out of condoms, so he sold 'em dirty socks!

 Buell the Kind was also there, that beggar meek and mild,
 He didna' do the ladies, he had brought his favourite child!

 (insert name) he was there at the revel feast
 He doesn't like the girls, and the boys call him "The Beast!"

 And in the morning, early, the Farmer nearly shat
 For four and twenty acres was nearly fuckit flat!

 It was a grand old party, lads, and sure a Locksley Plot
 And every lad and lassie there was glad of what they got!

 And when the Ball was over, everyone confessed
 The music it was wonderful, but the "doin's" were the best!

                     If y'canna' get laid on Saturday nicht
                     You canna' get laid at all!

 The Minister's wife, she was there, buckled tae th' front
 Wi' a wreath of roses round her arse, and thistles round her cunt!

 The Minister's dochter, she was there, an' she gat roarin' fu'
 Sae they doubled her ower the midden wa' and did her like a coo!

 The undertaker he was there, in a long black shroud
 Swinging from the chandelier, and pissing on the crowd!

 (insert name) was there, as well, she kept us all in fits
 Jumping off the mantlepiece, and bouncing on her tits!

 The village cooper he was there; he had a mighty tool!
 He pulled his foreskin over his head, and yodeled thru the hole!

 The local vicar, he was there, his collar back to front
 He said, "My girls, thy sins are blessed!" and shoved it up their

 The local surgeon, he was there, with his knife in hand,
 And every time he turned around, he circumsized a man!

 The village idiot he was there, up to his favorite trick:
 Bouncin' on his testicles and whistlin' thru his prick!

 The village fireman was there, quenchin' lassie's fires
 He diddled 'em in the firetruck, right beside the tires!
 
 (insert name) was also there, standing back-to-front,
 With thirteen inches of candlestick inserted in her cunt!

 The village nympho, she was there, wi' a happy grin
 Every hole was stuffit fu', and she was fu' o' quim!

 The village glazier he was there, with his prick of glass
 He diddled 'em in their cunnys, and also in the ass!

 One female musician was some sight to watch
 With "Dowland" from her lute, and "Palestrina" from her crotch!

 There was doin's in the bedrooms, there was doin's in the tub
 'Till every single pecker there was worn down to a nub!

 The bride was in the bedroom, explainin' to the groom:
 The vagina, not the rectum, is the entrance to the womb! 

 The King was in the counting house, counting out his wealth;
 The Queen was in the parlor, playin' with herself!

 (insert name) he was there, his balls was made of brass
 And when he blew a fart, m'lads, sparks flew out his ass! 

 The tailor was a busy man; his work went to his head
 Sewing up the stretched-out cunts with miles and miles of thread!

 The Elder Statesmen all were there; they were too old to firk,
 So they sat around the table and they had a circle-jerk!

 (insert name) was excited and racin' round the hall
 A-pullin' on his pecker and showin' off his balls!

 The Parson's wife, she was there; she was the worst of all:
 She pulled her skirts above her head and shouted: "Fuck it all!"

 He did his lassie fourteen times before he finally came!

 (name) and (name) they were there, and they were quite a pair,
 Each did a lassie seven times, and never touched the hair!

 (insert name) he was there, up to his old trick:
 Dancin' naked 'round the room, pirouettin' on his prick!

 (insert name) he was there, but he wouldna' dance,
 Just sat there with his ten-inch rise, a-waitin' for his chance!

 (insert name) he was there; he was the perfect fool:
 He sat beneath the old oak tree, and whittled off his tool!

 (insert name) he was there, up from Dungaree
 With a yard-and-a-half of Glory, that hung below his knee!

 The Queen, she had a chicken, the King he had a duck,
 So they put them on the table to see if they would fight!

 The cows were wearin' bridles, the horses wearin' bits
 The Queen she wore two harness-rings thru the nipples of her tits!

 (insert name) he was there, grinnin' at the Queen
 He'd built himself a dildo, and powered it by steam!

 (insert name) he was there, that rowdy rantin' bloke
 Masturbatin' all by himself with a backhand double stroke!     

 The Royal Fool was also there, sittin' in the hall,
 Tryin' to do a mongoose with an india-rubber ball!

 (insert name) he was there, that egocentric elf,
 The ladies were na' guid enough, so he went and fucked himself! 

 (insert name) she was there, and she was very strange:

 (insert name) he was there, but he was fast asleep
 The ladies wouldna have him, and we'd run clean out of sheep!

 (insert name) he was there, big and strong and mean,
 Out behind the bushes, boys, picking his next Queen!

 They tried it on the garden path, and once around the park,
 And when the candles snotted out, they diddled in the dark!

 First they did it simple, then they tried it he's and she's,
 But before the ball was over, they went at it fives and threes!

 The groom was in the corner, oiling up his tool,
 The bride was in the icebox, her private parts to cool!

 (s)he didn't want the doin's, just a lot of alcohol!

 First lady over, second lady front,
 Third lady's finger up the fourth lady's cunt!

 Fifth lady worn and dry, sixth lady passed,
 Seventh lady's finger up the eighth lady's ass!

 Ninth lady forward, tenth lady back,
 Eleventh lady's finger in the twelfth lady's crack!

 (insert name) he was there, givin' happy sighs!
 His rise had used up so much skin he couldna close his eyes!

 A strapping Scotsman he was there, known to all as "Ronald"
 His rise it weighed a quarter-pound...he must be a MacDonald!

 Bunny Foo-foo he was there, hoppin' thru the wood,
 Doin' the Good Fairy like a horny rabbit should!

 Big Goon Foo-Foo, he was there, stomping thru the weeds

              THE BANTAM COCK
              (Recorded: "Celtic Pride: In Strange Form")
                            
      He was a fine upstanding bantam-cock
      So brisk, and stiff, and spry...
      With a springy step, and a jaunty plume,
      And a purposeful look in his eye
      In his little black laughing eye!

      So I took him to the coop and introduced him to
      My seventeen wide-eyed hens
      And he tupped and he tupped as a hero tupps,
      And he bowed to them all, and then,
      He up and took 'em all again!

      Then upon the peace of my ducks and geese
      He boldly did intrude
      And with glazed eyes and opened mouths
      They bore him with fortitude...
      And a little bit of gratitude!

      He jumped my giggling guinea-fowl!
      He thrust his attentions upon
      Twenty hysterical turkeys,
      And a visiting migrant swan!
      And the bantam thundered on!

      He groped my fan-tail pigeon doves,
      My lily-white Columbine,
      And as I was lookin' at me budgerigar,
      He jumped my parrot from behind!
      And it was sittin' on me shoulder at the time!

      But all of a sudden, with a gasp and a gulp,
      He clapped his wings to his head!
      He lay flat on his back with his feet in the air;
      My bantam-cock was dead!
      And the vultures circled overhead!

      What a noble beast! What a champion cock!
      What a way to live and die!
      As I dug him a grave to protect his bones,
      From those hungry buzzards in the sky,
      The bantam opened up his eyes!

      He gave me a wink, and a terrible grin,
      The way that rapists do....
      He said, "Do you see them silly daft buggers up there?
      They'll be down in a minnit 'er two!
      They'll be down in a minnit 'er two!"

             THE BASTARD KING OF ENGLAND
             -attributed to Rudyard Kipling, but probably not!

 Oh the mistrels sing of an English King of many long years ago
 who ruled his Land with an iron hand tho his morals were weak and low
 his only outer garment was a dirty yellow shirt
 with which he served to hide his hide, but he couldn't hide the dirt

 He was dirty, and lousy, and full of fleas
 but a Royal Tool hung to his knees
 God bless the Bastard King of England!

 Now the Queen of Spain was an amorous Jane, a lascivious wench was she
 who heard about the prowess of this King from over the sea
 so she sent a Royal Message by a Royal Messenger
 to ask the King of England to spend the night with her

 He was dirty and lousy and full of fleas
 but he kept his women by twos and threes....
 God Bless the Bastard King of England!

 When Philip of France heard of this chance, he swore before his Court
 "The Queen prefers my rival just because mine's...somewhat short."
 So he sent the Count of Zippety-Zap
 to give to the Queen a Dose of Clap
 to pass it on to the Bastard King of England!
 
 When the King of England heard the news, he cursed the Gallic farce
 and he up and swore by the Royal Whore he'd have the Frenchman's arse
 So he offered half his Kingdom, and a piece of Queen Hortense
 To any Royal Subject who'd undo the King of France
 
 So the brave young Duke of Buckingham went instantly to France
 He swore he was a fruitier; the King took down his pants.
 So in front of the throng he slipped on a thong
 and jumped on his horse and he galloped along
 dragging the Frenchman back to Merrie England!

 When the King of England saw the sight he fainted dead on the floor,
 for during the ride his rival's hide had stretched...a yard...or more!
 and all the girls of England came down to London Town
 and shouted round the battlements "To hell with the British Crown!"
 
 So Philip of France usurped the Throne 
 his scepter was his Royal Bone
 with which he bitched the Bastard King of England!

CHORUS: He swore the world was round-o
        America could be found-o
        That masturbatin', fornicatin'
        Son-of-a-bitch, Columbo!

 In fourteen hundred and ninety two
 A gob from old Italee
 Went wandering thru the streets of Spain
 A-pissing in the alley

 In fourteen hundred and ninety two        
 The expedition started                    
 Queen Isabel, she cried like hell         
 Columbus only farted                      

 Columbus paced upon the deck         
 He knew it was his duty              
 He laid his whang into his hand      
 and said "Ain't that a beauty!"      

 The sailor's on Columbus' ship
 Each had his private knothole
 But Columbo was a superman
 and used a padded porthole!

 The bo's'ns mate fell overboard
 The sharks did leap and frolic
 They gobbled him up in one big bite
 And shortly died of colic!

 For forty days and forty nights
 They sailed the broad Atlantic
 Columbo and his lousy crew
 For want of a piece were frantic!

 They spied a whore upon the shore
 And off came shirts and collars
 In twenty minutes by the clock
 She'd made ten thousand dollars! 

 With joyful shout they ran about      Columbo went back to the Queen
 And practiced fornication             Because it was his duty
 When they sailed, they left behind    He gave to her a dose of clap
 Ten times the population!             He had no other booty

 And when his men pulled out again      So they threw him in a stinking jail
 To take the homeward tour up           And left him there to grumble
 They'd caught the Pox from every box   A ball and chain tied to his balls
 That syphilized all Europe!            So ended poor Columbo!

                 THE SPERM SONG
             (from Monty Python)

 There are Jews in the world, There are Buddhists. 
 There are Hindus and Mormons and then...
 There are those that follow Mohammed 
 But I've never been one of them...

 I'm a Roman Catholic, 
 And have been since before I was born.
 And the one thing they say about Catholics is, 
 They'll take you as soon as you're warm.

 You don't have to be a six-footer, 
 You don't have to have a great brain,
 You don't have to have any clothes on, 
 You're a Catholic the moment Dad came.

 Because...

 Every sperm is sacred, Every sperm is great,
 If a sperm is wasted, God gets quite irate.

 Let the heathens spill theirs On the dusty ground,
 God shall make them pay for Each sperm that can't be found.

 Every sperm is wanted, Every sperm is good,
 Every sperm is needed, In your neighboorhood.

 Every sperm is useful, Every sperm is fine,
 God needs everybody's, Mine and mine and mine.

 Let the pagans spill theirs, On mountain here and then,
 God will strike them down for each sperm that's spilt in vain.

 Every sperm is sacred, Every sperm is good,
 Every sperm is needed In your neighborhood.

         THE FARTING CONTEST
         (Tune: Sweet Betsy From Pike)

 I'll tell you a story that is sure to please
 Of a great farting contest at Sutton-on-Pease
 Where all the best arses paraded the field
 To compete in a contest for various shields.
           Some tighten their arses and fart up the scale
           To compete for a cup, or a barrel of ale,
           While others, whose arses are biggest and strongest,
           Compete in the section for loudest and longest.

 Now, this year's event had drawn quite a big crowd
 And the betting was even on Mrs. McDowd
 For it had appeared, in the evening edition,
 That this lady's arse was in perfect condition.
           Miss Bingle arrived amid roars of applause
           And promptly proceeded to pull off her drawers
           For, though she'd no chance in the farting display
           She'd the prettiest bottom you'd see in a day!

 Now, young Mrs. Porter was backed for a place
 though she'd often been placed in the deepest disgrace
 by dropping a fart on a Sunday in church
 And disturbing the sermon of Reverend McGurk!
           The ladies lined up, at the signal to start,
           And, winning the toss, Mrs. Jones to first fart;
           The people around stood in silence and wonder,
           While her wireless transmitted gale force and thunder!

 Now, Mrs. McDowd reckoned nothing of this
 For she'd had some weak tea, and was all wind and piss;
 So she took up her place, and her arse opened wide,
 But, unluckily, shit, and was disqualified!
           Then young Mrs. Porter was called to the front
           And started by doing a wonderful stunt:
           She took a deep breath, and, clenching her hands,
           She blew the damnned roof off the popular stands!

 This left young Miss Bingle, who shyly appeared,
 And smiled at the clergy, who lustily cheered!
 And though it was thought that her chances were small,
 She ran out a winner, out-farting them all!
           She went to the rostrum with dignified gait,
           And took from the Vicar a set of gold plate,
           Then she turned to the clergy, with sweetness sublime,
           And, smiling, said "Come up and see me sometime!"

 The clergy was shocked by Miss Bingle's remark,
 Though some felt a stirring 'neath vestment and sark,
 Perhaps t'was the wind - but who could have guessed?
 And that was the end of the farting contest!

 And we'll burn the Sistine Chapel to the ground!
 Then we'll turn our tommy-guns on the screaming ravished nuns
 And the People's Voice will be the only sound!

 Then you better give your money to the poor!
 Or we'll sell your mother's twat to a sailor on your yacht
 And we'll turn your favourite daughter to a hoor!

 Then up come handsome Sally, her cheeks as red as bloom.
 Move up me jolly sisters and give young Sally room
 For I'll be your equal before we then go out.
 These four drunken maidens they pushed the jug about.

 There's woodcock and pheasant, there's partridge and hare,
 There's all sorts of dainties, no scarcity was there.
 There's forty quarts of beer, me boys, they fairly drunk them out.
 These four drunken maidens they pushed the jug about.

 Then up come the landlord, he's asking for his pay.
 It's a forty pound bill, me boys, these girls have got to pay.
 That's ten pounds apiece, me boys, but still they wouldn't go out.
 These four drunken maidens they pushed the jug about.

 Oh, where are your feathered hats, your mantles rich and fine?
 They've all been swallowed up in tankards of good wine.
 And where are your maidenheads, you maidens brisk and gay?
 We left them in the alehouse, we drunk them clear away!

                 THE FRIGGIN' FALCON
                      -Theodore R. Cogswell
                (Tune: "Ghost Riders In the Sky")

 I was walkin' out one evening by the friggin' reservoir
 A-wishing that I had a quid to pay my friggin' score
 My head it was a-achin' and my throat was parched and dry
 So I up and sent a little prayer wingin' to the sky

 Then there came a friggin' falcon and He walked upon the waves
 And I said "A friggin' miracle!" and sang a couple staves
 Of a friggin' churchly ballad I learned at me mother's knee
 But when the friggin' bird took off he went and spattered me!

 I dropped upon my friggin' knees and bowed my friggin' head
 And said three friggin' Aves for all the friggin' dead
 And then I rose up to my feet and said another ten
 The friggin' bird burst into flame and spattered me again!

 The falcon blazed up in the sky just like a friggin' sun
 And seared my friggin' eyelids shut and when the job was done
 He whooshed across the friggin' sky just like a shooting star
 I went to see the friggin' priest; he bummed my last cigar!

 I told him of the burning bird, he told me of the Rose
 I showed him guano in my hair, the bastard held his nose!
 So I went to see the Bishop, but the friggin' Bishop said
 "Go home and sleep it off, you sod, and wash your friggin' head!"

 Then I came upon a friggin' wake for a lousy friggin' swine
 By the name of Jock O'Leary and I touched his head with mine
 He sat up in his friggin' box, and he shook his friggin' head
 His wife pulled out a .44, and filled him full of lead!

 Then I lost my friggin' temper and let out a friggin' yell
 "Blow one more hole in poor old Jock and I'll see you burn in Hell!"
 And once again I raised him up and brought him back to life
 Jock whimpered as his head came off...this time she used a knife!

 And then she flopped upon her knees and started in to pray
 "Please, Lord," she said, "It's thirty years I've waited for this day!"
 Still I went about the friggin' town to heal the friggin' lame
 But every time I raised them up, they got knocked down again!

 How the good Lord sends His blessings down in a friggin' curious way
 But when He's marked a man for Love, that Love is there to stay
 But the way you've got to use that Love is a friggin' queer affair
 There ain't no point to raisin' stiffs, and there ain't no point to prayer

 And this I know because I've got an ever-flowing sign
 For every time I wash my head, the water turns to wine!
 And I give it free to working blokes to brighten their poor lives
 So they don't kick no dogs around, or beat up on their wives

 For there ain't no point to miracles like walking on the sea
 They crucified the Son of God, but they don't muck with me!
 For I leave the friggin' blind alone and the dying and the dead
 But every day at four o'clock...I wash my friggin' head!

CHORUS: Oh, glad tidings of reason and fact,
        Reason and fact.
        Glad tidings of reason and fact.

 We're too sophisticated to believe in tales so old.
 We know that human avarice means too much bought and sold
 We only celebrate because this season is so cold.

 No wise men traveled from the East, the journey's far too long.
 There were no shepherds in the fields, the time of year's all wrong.
 We don't believe in angels; that rules out the angels' song!

                 GOD'S GREAT GIFTS
                (from Monty Python)

 All things dull and ugly, All creatures great and squat
 All things rude and nasty, The Lord God made the lot.

 Each little snake that poisons, Each little wasp that stings
 He made their brutish venom, He made their horrid wings.

 All things sick and cancerous, All evil great and small
 All things foul and dangerous, The Lord God made them all.

 Each nasty little hornet, Each beastly little squid
 Who made the spikey urchin, Who made the sharks? He did.

 All things scabbed and ulcerous, All pox both great and small
 Putrid, foul and gangrenous, The Lord God made them all.

 Amen.

                GOODBYE TO ALL THAT
                         -John Ball
                (Tune: "Farewell to the Rhondda")

CHORUS: Farewell you Kingdom officers, the politics and crap;
        Farewell you Hatted Valley Girls, we never will come back!
        The foreign wars are calling, at least the money's good!
        And you can take your Kingdom and do with it what you would!

 Our fathers built a Kingdom, from nothing in the desert
 I watched them work with heart and soul to build
 Something worthwhile, for the keeping, but now my heart is weeping
 And I can't stay and see their dreaming killed!

 Chivalry and honour, courtesie and kindness
 Are words that are forgotten and ignored
 For we must fight to win, and counting blows' a sin
 So I think I'll go and join the bloody Horde!

 The Belted Boys are arrogant; they think they run the Kingdom
 They've made the Dream into a bloody whore!
 For chivalry's forgotten, and the membership is droppin'
 And I'll not put up with it any more!

                 THE GOOD SHIP VENUS
                          -Anonymous

It was on the good ship Venus        The Captain's name was Morgan
My God, you should have seen us!     By God, he was a gorgon!
The figurehead was a whore in bed,   Ten times each day sweet tunes he'd play
And the mast, an upright penis!      On his reproductive organ!

The Captain of this lugger       The Captain's wife was Mable
He was a dirty bugger!           To screw, she wasn't able
He wasn't fit to shovel shit     So the dirty shits, they nailed her tits
From one place to another!       Across the Captain's table!

The Mate's name it was Andy
By God, he had a dandy!
Till they crushed his cock with a jagged rock
For coming in the brandy!
                                      
The second mate was Hooper             Another daughter, Charlotte
By God, he was a trooper!              Born and bred a harlot
He jerked and jerked until he worked   At night her thighs were lily white
Himself into a stupor!                 By morning they were scarlet!

The cabin boy, the cabin boy,          The Captain's dog was Rover
The dirty little nipper;               We rolled that poor dog over
He filled his ass with broken glass,   Ten times each day all along the way
And circumcised the Skipper!           From Calais back to Dover!

The Captain's daughter, Mable,     The Boatswains Mate named Carter
Was ready, willing and able,       Was quite an able farter
To fornicate with the second mate  Played anything from "God Save the Queen"
Upon the chartroom table!          To Beethoven's " 'Moon' Sonata"

The Captain's daughter, Mary,        The Captain had a First Mate
Had never lost her cherry,           He loved him like a brother
The men grew bold, and offered gold: And every night in the pale moonlight
Now there's no Virgin Mary!          They buggered one another!

The Captain's other daughter         The passengers were whiney
Fell in the deep sea water           They'd drunk up all their winey
Delighted squeals revealed that eels From bed to bed they looked for head
Had found her sexual quarter!        But settled for some hiney.

Aboard the good ship Venus         The Captain had a one-eyed cat
We sailors all were henious:       He kept it in the cabin
It was our fate to masturbate      He rubbed its ass with axle grease
And that develops meanness!        And started in a-jabbin'!

The trip it was exciting
The pleasures were inviting
All day we blew - all night we'd screw
By artificial lighting!

One day the good ship foundered          And when we reached our station
On crags our bags were pound(er)ed       We found to our elation
We stubbed our cocks against the rocks,  The ship had sunk in a sea of spunk
And then, we all were drownd(er)ed!      From mutual masturbation!

           HAS ANYBODY SEEN MY LORD? 
     (Tune: "Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue.")
 
           Five foot nine

            He is Boss
            He is Cool
            Watch Him walk across your pool
            Has anybody seen my Lord?

            He can brag
            He can boast
            His mother was a Virgin and his Father was a Ghost
            Has anybody seen my Lord?

                  IN DAYS OF OLD
                         -Anonymous & Ioseph of Locksley
          (Tune: "The Girl I left Behind Me")

SCA: In days of old, when knights were bold,
     And rubbers weren't invented;
     They used old socks
     To cover up their jocks
     And babies were prevented!
             But now we're in the SCA
             And we always get our fill, sir!
             For the boys take matters firm in hand
             And the girls are on the Pill, sir!

     In days of old, when knights were bold,
     And women weren't particular
     They lined them up
     Against the wall
     And diddled 'em perpendicular!
             But now we're in the SCA
             And any old way is fine, sir!
             So choose your lass and go to town,
             As long as she's not mine, sir!

     In days of old, when knights were bold
     And paper not invented
     They wiped their ass
     With tufts of grass
     And, thereby, were contented!
             But now we're in the SCA
             And a public park's a gas, sir!
             For a toilet seat is very neat
             When you have to park your ass, sir!

MUNDANE:   Last night I slept in a hollow log
           With the girl I love beside me;
           Tonight I sleep in a feather bed
           And she's right there beside me

           She jumped in bed and covered up her head
           And said I couldn't find her
           But she knew damn well she lied like hell
           So I jumped in bed beside her!

                   I diddled her once, I diddled her twice,
                   I diddled her once too often.....
                   I broke a spring, or some damn thing
                   I diddled her to her coffin......

  So I will go to Mother and complain of this to her.

  "Well, son of mine, I've taught you to forgive and to forget,
  And if your father sowed his oats, well, still you needn't fret.
  Your father may be father to all the girls, but still,
  He's not the one who fathered you, so marry who you will!"

 They threw up the LIE and they changed all the RULES
 Opened Crown Tourney to all but the fools,
 They opened Crown Tourney to sweep up the BULL
 And let in the People, a real Miracle!
 They swept up the BULL and laughed at the BOARD
 And every man-jack of 'em joined the Dark Horde!
 And so they lived happy, and wealthy and wise
 And if this is treason, then it's all a LIE

 And California grows the Long-stemmed L.A. rose,
 Berlin nights are full of life, and lovely,

                THE MERMAID
                    -Shel Silverstein

 When I was a lad in a fishing town, 
 an old man said to me
 You can spend your life, your jolly life, 
 a-sailing on the sea
 You can search the world for pretty girls 
 'til your eyes grow weak and dim
 But don't go swimmin' with a mermaid, son, 
 if you don't know how to swim!
         'Cause her hair is green as sea-weed
         Her lips are blue and pale
         I'll tell you now before you start
         You can love that girl with all your heart
         But you'll only love the upper part;
         You will -not- like the tail!

 I signed on to a whalin' ship, 
 and my very first day at sea
 I spied a mermaid in the waves, 
 a-reachin' out to me
 Come live with me in the sea, said she, 
 and down on the ocean's floor
 I'll show you a million wond'rous sights 
 you've never seen before!

 So I jumped on in and she pulled me down, 
 down to her sea-weed bed
 A pillow she made of tortoise shells, 
 and placed beneath my head
 She fed me shrimp and caviar 
 from a silvery dish
 She was just my taste (down to her waist) 
 but the rest of her was fish!
         Her hair was green as seaweed
         Her lips were blue and pale
         Her face it was a work of art
         But I only gave her half my heart
         'Cause tho I loved the upper part;
         I did -not- like the tail!

 And then one day when I looked up
 I saw a sailin' ship
 And I met the stare of a millionaire
 Out on a fishing trip
 A diamond ring he tied on a string 
 And lowered it down to her
 And my love divine, she went for the line
 And went for the usual lure!

 So I sighed in the rolling tide, 
 and I cried to the clams and the whales
 How I missed her hair and her seagreen eyes; 
 I missed the shine of her scales
 Just then her sister swam on by, 
 and set my heart a-whirl....
 For her upper part was an ugly old fish.....
 but the -bottom- half was GIRL!
         Her toes are round and rosey!
         Her legs are slim and pale!
         Her face might not be a work of art
         But I love that girl with all my heart
         And I don't give a damn about the upper part
         That's how I end my tale! ('cause now I'm getting tail!)

                   MOLLY MALONE
                         -Ioseph of Locksley

 In Dublin's fair city, where the girls have no titties
 T'was there that I first met sweet Molly Malone
 You could have her for a penny, and be one of many,
 But for sixpence she would act alive, alive-o!

         Alive, alive-o! Alive alive-o!
         But for sixpence she would act alive, alive-o!

 She was a street walker, and sure t'was no wonder
 For so were her mother and grandmother too,
 With a mattress on the barrow, thru streets broad and narrow,
 And for sixpence they would act alive, alive-o!

         Alive, alive-o! Alive alive-o!
         And for sixpence they would act alive, alive-o!

 She died of a fever, and no one could save her;
 It was caught from a folkie from Ontario,
 Now her ghost wheels the barrow thru streets broad and narrow
 But a ghost can't be had that's alive, alive-o!

         Alive, alive-o! Alive alive-o!
         But a ghost can't be had that's alive, alive-o!

                THE MODEST WENCH 
                         -David of Bagulay 

 A comely young wench from the south        
 Went travelling far and free   
 She said "I'm searching for love as true as the dove!"
 And she came to the north country

 CHORUS: Saying "I beg your pardon, Sir!
         I am but a modest wench....
         A lovely lively lusty busty rather outrageous wench  
         But a modest one, nevertheless!"

 She met with two grinning dwarves
 Said one to the other: "What bliss!
 You stand on her shoulder; together we'll hold her
 And give her a rousing kiss!"

 She met with a leering banker
 Who said "Banking has various facets...
 I could invest all your money till the ledgers looked funny,
 But I'd rather hold onto your assets!"

 She met with a hungry giant
 Who roared in stentorian tones
 "To pepper I'd falter; I'd rather assault her
 before I devour her bones!"

 She met with a country lout
 who said,"Massage me here on this hummock.
 Like my girlfriend who felt she should stop at the belt
 And never got up to my stomach..."

 She met with a charming minstrel
 "At last sir can you show me true love?"
 He chortled with glee as he patted her knee     
 He rubbed his hands as he fired up his glands     
 He looked very droll as he turned into a troll
 And sneered "Certainly! From below or above!"

           "I beg your pardon, sir!
           I -was- but a modest wench...
           A lovely lively lusty busty rather outrageous wench
           But a modest one....never the more!"

                  THE MOOSE SONG
                       -Thomas Payton, et. al.
                  (tune: "Betsy From Pike")
 
 When I was a young girl (man) I used to like boys (girls),
 I fondled their tights (bodies) and played with their toys (curls),
 But me boy (girl) friend ran off with a salesman named Bruce,
 You'd never get treatment like that from a Moose!

 CHORUS: So it's Moose, Moose, I like a Moose,
         I've never had anything quite like a Moose,
         I've had many lovers, my life has been loose,
         But I've never had anything quite like a Moose!

 Now when I'm in need of a very good lay,
 I go to me stables and gets me some hay,
 I opens me window and spreads it around,
 'Cause Moose always comes when there's hay on the ground!

 Now I've made it with all kinds of beasties with hair,
 I'd make it with snakes if their fangs were not there,
 I've made it with walrus, two ducks and a goose,
 But I've never had anything quite like a Moose!
                                                      
 Now gorillas are fine for a Saturday night,
 And lions and tigers, they puts up a fight,
 But it just ain't the same when you slams your caboose
 As the feeling you gets when you humps with a Moose!

 I've tried many beasties on land or on sea
 I've even tried hump-backs that humped back on me!
 Sharks are quite good, tho they're hard to pull loose
 But on dry land there is nothing quite like a moose!

 Woodchucks are all right except that they bite
 And foxes and rabbits won't last thru the night!
 Cows would be fun, but they're hard to seduce
 But you never need worry should you find a moose!

 Step in my study, and trophies you'll find
 A black striped tiger and scruffy maned lion
 You'll know the elephant by his ivory tooth
 And the one that's a-winking, you know is the moose!

 The lion succumbed to a thirty-ought-six
 Machine guns and tigers I've proved do not mix
 The elephant fell by a bomb with a fuse
 But I won't tell a soul how I did in the moose!

 I've found many women attracted to me
 A few of them have had me over for tea
 Some say that they love me when they're feeling loose
 But I'd trade the world's women for one lovely moose!

 The good Lord made Adam, and then He made Eve
 Said He: "If you sin now, I'll ask you to leave!"
 They left not because of Eve's forbidden fruit
 But 'cause Adam decided the moose there were cute!

The Moose Song (Cont.)

 The English are said to like boars who've had corn
 The Celtics just dream of the young Unicorn
 The Germans, it's said, just need leather and rope
 But give me a moose and I'll no longer mope!

 Now I've broken the laws in this god-awful state
 They've put me in prison and locked up the gate
 They say that tomorrow I'll swing from a noose
 But my last night I'll spend with a good sexy moose!

 Next morning the Governor's word reached my ears
 "We've commuted your sentence to ninety-nine years!"
 "You won't get parole; not a five minute's truce,
 And your friend goes to Sing-Sing, he's so big-a-moose!"

(slowly) Now that I'm old and advanced in me years,
    I'll look back on me life, and I'll shed me no tears,
    As I sit in me chair with me glass of Mateuse,
    And play hide the salami with Marvin (Millie) the Moose!

             OLD DRUBBED DING
                   -Anonymous
           (Tune: "Old Used Queen")

 Once I was a swyver of the finest kind, a ruler of the bed
 But now I spend my days as an old used thing and I find I'm rubbed too red!
 With a hey-ho derry up and down I sing,
 never any fun for an old drubbed ding!

 My owner spends his time in solemn prayer, and dreams of naked flesh
 I spend MY time in clothbound walls getting slapped when we`re too fresh
 With a hey-ho derry up and down I sing,
 never some relief for an old drubbed ding!

 The other men they sit and talk of baring, thrust and fling
 But when I come out the wenches flee, and won't give me a thing
 With a hey-ho derry up and down I sing,
 never any girls for an old drubbed ding!

 The other ones can rise and dive and frolic near the ass
 I'm the Model of Priapus, I'm hard as hell, but must not make a pass!
 With a hey-ho derry up and down I sing
 never any fun for an old drubbed ding!

 But someday soon there'll be a change, in Martin Luther's "rise,"
 And the Reformation's opening "shot" will land between his eyes!
 With a Hey-ho derry up and down WE'LL sing,
 Then there will be FUN for an old drubbed ding!

                 ONE-BALL RILEY
                   -Traditional Irish

    As I was sittin by the fire 
    talking to O'Riley's daughter
    suddenly a thought came into my head: 
    I'd like to shag O'Riley's daughter

(Chorus):  Giddy aye ay, giddy aye ay, 
           giddy aye ay for the one-ball Riley
           Giddy aye ay:  (three claps or stomps) 
           try it on yer own big drum!

    Her hair was black and her eyes were blue
    The Colonel and the Major and the Captain sought her
    The Sergeant and the Private and the Drummer boy too
    All of 'em shagged O'Riley's daughter!

    Riley played on the big bass drum; 
    Riley had a mind for murder and slaughter
    Riley had a bright red glitterin eye 
    and he kept that eye on his lovely daughter

    While walking thru the park one day
    Who should I spy but Riley's daughter?
    Never a word I had to say
    But "Don't you think we really oughter?"

    Got me a bottle and a condom too, 
    got me hands on Riley's daughter
    settled me down for a good old time 
    doin' things we shouldn't oughter

    Up the stairs and into bed
    I shagged and shagged until I stove her
    Never a word that maiden said
    just laughed like hell till the fun was over!

    Suddenly a footstep on the stair 
    who should it be but Riley out for slaughter
    with two pistols in his hands 
    lookin for the man that shagged his daughter

    Grabbed Old Riley by the ball, 
    rammed his head in a pail of water
    shoved them pistols up his ass 
    a damn sight quicker than I shagged his daughter!

    As I go walkin' down the street
    People shout from every corner
    There's the randy sonofabitch
    That finally shagged Old Riley's daughter!

    Now all you lasses, all you maids
    Answer me now, and don't speak shyly
    Would you have it straight and true
    Or the way I gave it to One-Ball Riley?

       OUR BABY DIED LAST NIGHT

       Our Baby died last night
       It lived for 48 hours
       And it cost a hundred dollars
       It was a lousy baby, anyway.

       His head it turned to mush;
       It skwushed between my fingers;
       The memory still lingers;
       It was a lousy baby, anyway.

       Although he tried to bite us
       He died for just to spite us
       Of spinal meningitus
       It was a lousy baby, anyway...

  I don't care if it rains or freezes, long as I got my plastic Jesus
  Riding on the dashboard of my car
  Thru my trials and tribulations, and my travels thru the nations
  With my plastic Jesus I'll go far!
  Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus, riding on the dashboard of my car
  Thru my trials and tribulations, and my travels thru the nations
  With my plastic Jesus I'll go far!

  I don't care if its dark or scary, long as I have Magnetic Mary
  Ridin' on the dashboard of my car
  I feel I'm protected, amply, got the whole damn Holy Family
  Ridin' on the dashboard of my car
  Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus
  Ridin' on the dashboard of my car
  But I think he'll have to go, his magnet ruins my radio
  And if I have a wreck he'll leave a scar!

  Riding down a thoroughfare, with His Nose up in the air
  A wreck may be ahead, but He don't mind
  Trouble coming He don't see, he just keeps an eye on me
  And any other thing that lies behind
  Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus
  Ridin' on the dashboard of my car
  Tho the sunshine on His Back makes Him peel and chip and crack
  A little patching keeps Him up to par!

  When pedestrians try to cross, I just let' em know who's boss
  I never blow the horn or give them warning
  I ride all over town, a-tryin' to run 'em down!
  And its seldom that they live to see the morning
  Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus
  Ridin' on the dashboard of my car
  His Halo fits just right, and I use It for a sight!
  And they scatter, or they'll splatter near and far!

  When I'm in a traffic jam, he don't care if I say "Damn!"
  I can let all sorts of curses roll
  Plastic Jesus doesn't hear, for He has a plastic Ear
  The man who invented plastic saved my soul!
  Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus
  Ridin' on the dashboard of my car
  Once His Robe was snowy-white, now it isn't quite so bright
  Stained by the smoke from my cigar

  If I weave around at night, and the police think I'm tight
  They'll never find my bottle, tho they ask
  Plastic Jesus shelters me, for His Head comes off, you see:
  He's hollow, and I use Him for a flask!
  Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus
  Ridin' on the dashboard of my car
  Ride with me and have a dram of the Blood of the Lamb
  Plastic Jesus is a Holy bar!

         PUFF THE JEWISH DRAGON
                     -Anonymous
     (Tune: "Puff the Magic Dragon")

 Puff the Jewish dragon, lived in Palestine,
 And frolicked in the synagogue and drank Manischewitz wine.
 Little Rabbi Goldberg loved that dragon Puff,
 And fed him lox and matzoh balls and other kosher stuff.

 Then one day it happened, Puff was eating pork,
 Little Rabbi Goldberg took that dragon for a walk.
 Gently he explained that dragons don't eat meat
 That comes from little piggies that have dirty filthy feet.

 Then Puff became Bar Mitzvah, put on tefillin every day,
 Wrapped up in his tallis that's the way that he would pray;
 Made brachos before eating, benched after every meal -
 Imagine how religious it made that dragon feel.

 Now there were some people who did things just for spite.
 They'd curse Jews and attack them just to get into a fight.
 When Puff the dragon saw this, he roared a mighty roar -
 Now those wicked people are not with us anymore.

 Now Puff the Jewish dragon found himself a bride,
 Now little kosher dragons are his source of joy and pride.
 They'll grow up doing mitzvahs, learning Torah, praying too,
 With Rabbi Goldberg teaching them what kosher dragons do.

 You who may be listening may think we're making fun,
 But deep down in this story is a moral for everyone.
 If dragons can wear a kippah, keep Shabbos and Kosher too,
 Then you can learn, like Puff did, to be a real good Jew.

CHORUS: Puff, the tragic faggot, went on a spree

 Together they would travel, like a boat with billowed sail
 Jackie kept his fingers pressed 'neath Puff's romantic tail
 Noble Kings and Princes bowed low whene're they came
 Pirates lowered EVERYTHING when Puff roared out his name!

 A faggot lives for AGES, but not so little boys;
 Ding-a-lings and Faery Rings make way for other toys.
 One grey night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
 And Puff, the tragic faggot, he ceased his fearless roar.

 His head was bent in sorrow, green tears fell like rain
 Puff no longer went to play along the "Cherry" Lane
 Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave
 So Puff the tragic faggot sadly crept into his cave.

 I went into a tavern to get me some lunch

 But names will never hurt me, so leave me alone!

 She patted my hump, as I caressed her lip!

 The womens all love my deformity!

                   THE RED FLAG
      (Tune: "O Tannenbaum," "Maryland," &c.)

 While walking 'cross the rocks so bare
 I saw a maiden lying there
 And as she lay in sweet repose
 A breath of wind blew up her clothes
         A mongol who was passing by
         Lifted his hat and winked his eye
 And then he saw, to his despair,
 She had the Red Flag waving there!

 The mongol would not be denied
 He said "By God, I'll slip inside!"
 He stripped down to his underwear,
 And soon his ass was shining bare
         The maiden she was not disturbed
         Nor in the slightest bit perterbed
 For, come what may, full well she knew,
 The brave Red Flag would see her thru!

 The mongol he was shivering
 His mighty prick was quivering.
 But soon he knew he'd met his match,
 He could not penetrate her snatch!
         Try as he might, his path was blocked,
         All he could do was fire half-cocked;
 To quit the fray he did prepare,
 And leave the goddam Red Flag there!

 The moral of this tale is plain,
 But pardon me if I explain;
 In love, or war - it matters not,
 You never, ever waste a shot!
         The mongol's judgement was at fault
         To penetrate the maiden's vault
 With Red Flag flying, let it pass:
 Just shove it up the maiden's ass!

         OPTIONAL CHORUS:

                 The peasant class can kiss my ass!
                 I've got my Peerage, now, at last!
                 Don't bother me, I cannot work,

  There's never a maid, but by her will,
  Will keep it in her quiver still

  It is a friar with a bald head
  A staff to beat a cuckold dead
  It is a gun which shoots point blank
  And hits betwixt a woman's flank

  It has a head much like a mole's
  And yet it loves to creep in holes
  The fairest she that e'er took life
  For love of this became a wife!

  It would be twice as bawdy, and six times as long!

                THE SCA BE DAMNED!
           (Tune: "The Engineer's Song")

CHORUS: We are, we are, we are, we are, the goddam SCA
        And when we find a willing fuck, then we go out to play!
        If you don't like the songs I sing, then you can go get crammed 
        So sing out with the rest of us, "The SCA be damned!"

 Oh, listen all you maidens, oh, listen close to me
 Don't ever trust a Hordesman an inch above your knee
 He'll take you to the bushes and fill you full of fizz
 And before the night is over, your maidenhood is his!

 If I had a little girl I'd dress her all in white
 To give the clap to Caid's belts and keep 'em up all night
 But if I had a little boy, I'd dress him up in blue
 To yell "The King's a bastard!" like his daddy used to do!

 If we find an Ansteorran man within our sacred walls
 We'll give him to the Tuchux, who'll amputate his balls
 And if that doesn't fix him up, I'll tell you what we'll do
 We'll stuff his ass with broken glass and seal it up with glue!

 Oh here's to the King of (insert Kingdom name) the dirty son of a bitch
 We hope he dies of syphilis combined with seven year itch
 If you take his pecker's radius and project his balls in space
 You can prove by Occam's Razor that his asshole is his face!

 I was at the Pennsic War a-walkin' on the green
 Lookin' for some pussy, and there I found the Queen
 Her feet were wavin' in the air, her back was on the grass
 With a polished rattan dildo shoved right up her ass!

 The West is run by pussy, and the East by hairy crack
 The Middle's run by alcohol, and the Horde is run by yak!
 From what I hear of Atenveldt, they run it off by hand
 And a masturbating son of a bitch is the Asshole of the land!

 Ansteorra runs on bullshit, Artemesia runs on quim
 Trimaris is run by fairies, that bugger Atlantia's rim!
 But Caid's the worst of all, their peckers gather rust
 They run the Kingdom off by hand with lots of fairy dust!

 If I had a prick of steel, and balls of shiny brass
 I'd find a marble statue, and ram it up her ass
 Just to breed a race of giants, to roam throughout the land
 To swell the mighty chorus of "The SCA be dammned!"

         THE SEA CRABB                                               
  (c. 1620) Found in "Bawdy Verse, A Pleasant Collection"   

  It was a man of Africa had a fair wife,
  Fairest that ever I saw the days of my life.
    With a ging, Boys, ging, ging, boys, ging.
    Tarradiddle, farradiddle, ging, boys, ging!

  This goodwife was big-belly'd and with a lad
  And ever she longed for a sea crabb.
    With a ging, Boys, ging, ging, boys, ging.
    Tarradiddle, farradiddle, ging, boys, ging!

  The goodman rose in the morning and put on his hose
  He went to the seaside and followed his nose.
    With a ging, etc.

  Says, "God speed, Fisherman, sailing on the sea;
  Hast thou any crabbs in thy bote for to sell to me?"
    With a ging, etc.

  "I have crabbs in my bote one two three.
  I have crabbs in by bote for to sell thee."
    With a ging, etc.

  The good man went home and ere he wist
  Put the crabb in the Chamberpot where his wife pisst,
    With a ging, etc.

  The good wife she went to do as she was wont:
  Up started the Crabbfish and catcht her by the cunt.
    With a ging, etc.

  "Alas," quoth the goodwife, "that ever I was born;
  The Devil is in the pisspot and has me on his horns."
    With a ging, etc.

  "If you be a crabb or crabfish by kind,
  Thou'll let thy hold go with a blast of cold wind.";
    With a ging, etc.

  The good man laid to his mouth and began to blow
  Thinking thereby that the Crabb would let go.
    With a ging, etc.

  "Alas!" quoth the goodman, "that ever I came hither;
  He has joined my wife's tail and my nose together!"
    With a ging, etc.

  The good man called his neighbours in with great wonder
  To part his wife's tail and his nose asunder.
    With a ging, etc.

 So I called my wife, (audience shouts: HEY WIFE!)
 And I said to her, would you kindly tell to me
 Who owns that horse outside my door, where my old horse should be?
         Oh, you're drunk, you drunk, you silly old fool,
         Can't you plainly see?
         That's a lovely sow that my mother sent to me
         Well it's many a day I've travelled, a hundred miles or more
         But a saddle on a sow I've never seen before!

 When I came home on Tuesday night......etc.
 Saw a coat behind the door......etc.

 I saw a pipe upon the chair, where my old pipe should be..etc.
 ....Who owns that pipe.....
         ...That's a lovely tin-whistle that my mother sent to me!
         ...But tobacco in a tin-whistle I've never seen before!

 When I came home on Thursday night......etc.
 I saw two boots beneath the bed.......etc.

         ...They're two geranium-pots...etc.
         ...But laces in geranium-pots....etc.

 When I came home on Friday night......etc.

      THE SEXUAL LIFE OF THE CAMEL, or MY GOD HOW THE MONEY ROLLS IN!
                                                           -Anonymous

The sexual life of the Camel        My cousin sells shields to the Tuchux
Is stranger than anyone thinks      The plywood they're made of is thin;
One night in a moment of passion    I'm a doggone good Chiurgeon
He tried to deflower the Sphinx!    My God, how the money rolls in!

Now, the Sphinx's posterior anatomy      My brother is a mercenary 
Is covered with sand from the Nile.      Hiring out to help you win
That accounts for the hump in the Camel, Since both Kingdoms pay for his wages
And the Sphinx's inscrutable smile!      My God, how the money rolls in!

Exhaustive experimentation             The East and the Middle are fighting
By Darwin, and Huxley and Hall         Trimaris and others join in
Has proved that the ass of a hedgehog  The Dark Horde makes book on the winner
Can hardly be buggered at all!         My God, how the money rolls in!

The Baron, he rides on a warhorse,      Smilin' Ali is looking for people
With a fancy great helluva rig,         To travel a long way with him
He doesn't get there any faster,        To auctions in old Persian markets
But it makes the old bastard feel big!  My God, how the money rolls in!  

The King, he sleeps in a feather bed    I'm just a poor mercenary
The Knights all sleep in their sacks;   I don't care if we lose or we win
As a means of self-preservation,        As long as you're still here on payday
The squires all sleep on their backs!   My God, how the money rolls in!

And here's to the girls of (insert name)    Ioseph of Locksley is Celtic,
And here's to the alleys they roam,         Ioseph of Locksley is thin,
And here's to their dirty-faced bastards,   Ioseph writes satire to order,
God bless 'em, they may be your own!        My God, how the money rolls in!

My father makes illegal whiskey,          Petruccio is an Italian
My mother makes illegal gin,              He is an expert at Sin
My sister runs guns for the Dark Horde:   He has a stable of gerbils
My God, how the money rolls in!           My God, how the money rolls in!

My brother's a poor missionary          The Dark Horde really likes fighting
He saves little girlies from Sin!       We want your side to win
He'll save you a blonde for 5 dollars   We've cornered the market on duct tape
My God, how the money rolls in!         My God, how the money rolls in!

And here's to the Outlands' new Navy!   Elric, he drives a hard bargain
Let's all give them three cheers!       While trading for leather or skins
The first submarine made of adobe....   He'll let you keep yours for a cookie!
It's been down for thirty-two years!    My God, how the cookies roll in!

So here's to the War at Estrella          Elric's a traveling merchant
Where all of us landed in gaol,           With a band of his very large friends
And here's to the (insert name) maidens,  He'll sell you your lives for your
Who gave us our first piece of tail!                                  silver

             THE SHAPE OF THINGS
                      -Sheldon Harnick
            (copyright date unknown)

    Completely round is the perfect pearl 
      The oyster manufactures
    Completely round is the steering wheel 
      That leads to compound fractures!
    Completely round is the golden fruit 
      That hangs in the orange tree
    Yes the circle shape is quite renowned
    But sad to say, it can be found
    In the low-down dirty run-around
    My true love gave to me,
    Yes, my true love gave to me!

    Completely square was the velvet box 
      He said my ring would be in
    Completely square was the envelope 
      He said farewell to me in!
    Completely square is the handkerchief 
      I flourish constantly
    As it dries my eyes of the tears I shed
    And it blows my nose till it turns bright red!
    For a perfect square is my true love's head!
    He will not marry me!
    No, he will not marry me!

    Rectangular was the hotel door 
      My true love tried to sneak thru
    Rectangular was the transom-hole 
      By which I had to peek thru
    Rectangular was the hotel room 
      I entered angrily
    And rectangular is the wooden box
    Where lies my love of the golden locks
    They say he died of the chicken-pox....
    In part I must agree:
    One chick too many had he!

    Triangular is the piece of pie 
      I eat to ease my sorrow
    Triangular is the hatchet blade 
      I plan to hide tomorrow!
    Triangular the relationship 
      That now has ceased to be,
    And triangular is the garment thin
    That fastens on with a safety pin
    To a prize I had no wish to win....!
    It's a lasting memory
    That my true love gave to me!

                     THE SLEEPING SCOTSMAN
                              -Anonymous
                 (last 2 verses by Rich Bailey)

 A Scotsman clad in kilt left a bar one evening fair
 And one could tell by how he walked he'd drunk more than his share
 He stumbled on until he could no longer keep his feet
 Then staggered off into the grass to sleep, beside the street

 CHORUS: A ring-di-diddle-e-di do, a-ring-di-diddle-i-day
         He staggered off into the grass to sleep beside the street.

         (following choruses as above, repeating last line of verse)

 A pair of young and lovely girls just happened to come by
 And one said to the other, with a twinkle in her eye:
 "You see yon sleeping Scotsman, so strong and handsome built..
 I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt?"

 They crept upon the sleeping Scotsman, quiet as could be,
 And lifted up his kilt above the waist, so they could see..
 And there, behold, for them to view, beneath his Scottish skirt
 T'was nothing but what God has graced him with upon his birth!

 They marveled for a moment, then one said: "We'd best be gone.
 But let's leave a present for our friend before we move along!"
 So as a gift, they left a blue silk ribbon, tied into a bow,
 Around the Bonnie Star the Scottish kilt did lift and show!

 The Scotsman woke to Nature's Call, and stumbled towards a tree
 Behind the bush, he lifts his kilt, and gawks at what he sees!
 Then, in a startled voice he says to what's before his eyes:
 "I ken na' whaur y'been, m'lad, but I see y'won First Prize!"

 Our Scottish friend, still dressed in kilt, continued up the street
 He hadn't gone ten yards or more, when a lass he chanced to meet.
 She said: "I've heard what's underneath there, tell me, is it so?"
 He said: "Just slip your hand up, lass, if y'really want to know!"

 So she slipped her hand right up his kilt, and much to her surprise,
 The Scotsman smiled, and a very strange look came into his eyes,
 She said: "Why, sir, that's gruesome!" And then she heard him roar:
 "If you stick yer hand up once again, you'll find it grew some more!"

                  -Anthony R. Lewis
           (Tune: "MacNamara's Band")

 Oh, my name is Torquemada, I'm the leader of the band
 Altho we are few in numbers, we are feared throughout the land!
 We work on Jews and Protestants, we kick them as they fall,
 But when we work on heretics, we work the best of all!

 CHORUS: Oh the racks they creak, and the thumbscrews squeak
         And the whips they flail away!
         The Jesuit slams the Iron Maiden shut
         While I sit in the corner and pray!
         Oh, the auto-da-fe is God's chosen way
         And the screams of the victims are grand

                -note: not for the weak-kneed!

    Don't laugh when you see a Duke walk by
    For you may be the next to die!

    To fight with him is suicide
    Especially if you "rhino-hide!"

    As on the field your helm caves in;
    His sword is buried down to your chin!

    They'll take you out to the family plot
    And there you'll wither, decay, and rot!

    They'll take you out, and lower you down,
    And men with shovels will gather 'round!

    They wrap you up in a big white sheet
    And bury you under about six feet!

    And all goes well for about a week
    And then the coffin begins to leak!

    The worms crawl in, the worms crawl out,
    The worms hold revels upon your snout!

    They call their friends, and their buddies, too,
    They'll make a terrible mess of you!

    Your body turns a slimey green
    And pus runs out like whipping cream!

    Your hair turns white, your skin turns blue
    You don't look like you used to do!

    Your eyes fall in, your teeth fall out,
    Your liver turns to sauerkraut!

    And great big bugs with eyes of green
    Crawl in your liver and out your spleen!

    You become a thing that's very rare
    A smell worse than your underwear!

    So don't laugh when you see a Duke walk by
    For you may be the next to die!

 It takes a nasty man, to sing a nasty song (3X)
 I'm nasty now, and I'll be nasty all night long!

 Every single morning I insist on breakfast in bed
 So my Lady wraps her legs around my head!

 I say my bedtime prayers when the Mission bell rings eight
 O send me, Lord, a girl that wants to fornicate!

 They call me short, dark and handsome butI thank God they're wrong
 How can I be short, at a full nine inches long?

 My Liege Lord says I'm slow, but his daughter doesn't mind
 It's 'cause I'm slow, that I get a little behind....!

 I've got hair everywhere, from my head down to my feet
 And in my mouth it gets stuck between my teeth!

 I'll give you some kissin', girl, every single night
 If you want more than that, the line forms to the right!

 They say you are what you eat, I answer "Is that a fact?"
 If that is true, I'm a nymphomaniac!

                        -Anonymous
                (Tune: "Ruben, Ruben")

 Caviar comes from virgin sturgeon      The oyster's a prolific bivalve
 Virgin sturgeon's a mighty fine fish   Keeps its' innards in its' shell,
 Virgin sturgeon needs no urgin'        How they diddle is a riddle,
 That's why caviar is my dish!          But they do, so wotthehell!

 Shad roe comes from scarlet shad fish  The trout is just a little salmon,
 Shad fish have a very sad fate:        Just half-grown, and minus scales,
 Pregnant shad fish is a sad fish       But the trout, just like the salmon
 Got that way without a mate!           Can't get on without his tail!
  
 Mrs. Clam is optimistic                Give a thought to the happy codfish
 Shoots her eggs out in the sea         Always there when duty calls,
 Hopes her suitor is a shooter          Female cod fish is an odd fish
 Hits the selfsame spot as she!         From her come your cod fish balls!

 The green sea-turtle's mate is happy   A lucky fish is the common starfish
 With her lover's winning ways          When for offspring they essay;
 First he grips her with his flipper    Yes, me hearties, they have parties
 Then they flip for days and days!      In the good old fashioned way!

 I fed caviar to my Lady                I fed caviar to my grandpa
 She was a virgin tried and true        He was a man of ninety-three
 Now that virgin needs no urgin'        Shouts and screams were heard from
 Now there's nothin' she won't do!                                 grandma
                                        As he chased her up a tree!

 I fed caviar to my rooster             Every living thing will do it
 I fed caviar to my cow,                Without making lots of fuss
 Now the barnyard sure looks funny:     When they do it, they don't rue it,
 All the cows have feathers now!        So my darlin', why not us?

                  VATICAN CASKETS
                  (Tune: "Rock Of Ages")

         Vatican caskets are just fine
         Made of sandal-wood and pine
         When your loved ones have to go,
         Die with "cum Spiritu tuo!"
         When your loved one's pass away
         Have them pass the Vatican Way!
         Sistine Chapel, Saint Peter's, too
         Holy water just for you!

         Vatican caskets, unlike a rose,
         They will never decompose.
         For they stand the test of time;
         No need to kill the flies with lime!
         Get down on your knees and pray
         When your loved ones pass away!
         Vatican customers all sing:
         Death, O Death, where is thy sting?

                   THE WAGER

       My lady and her maid upon a merry pin,
       They made a match at farting, 
       Who should the wager win.

       Joan lights three candles then,
       And sets them bolt upright.
       With the first fart she blew them out
       With the next she gave them light

       In comes my lady then,
       With all her might and main
       And blew them out
       And in and out
       And in and out again.

     Well, floozie, baby, it looks like that I lied!
     Wake up little floozie (etc.)

     What're we gonna tell the Countess?
     What're we gonna tell the BoD?

                     -Ioseph of Locksley and countless others!
                     -tune: "Celito Lindo"

 A limerick packs laughs anatomical
 Into space that is quite economical
 But the good ones we've seen
 So seldom are clean
 And the clean ones so seldom are comical!        (T)

 (Chorus): Ai, ai, ai, ai!
           I am drunker than you are
           So sing me another verse

           And waltz me around again, Hrothgar!      (I)

 A randy young man from Caid
 Was discovered spreading his seed
 In horses and dogs,

 You will never sit 'round being bored
 Our ladies, and wives.
 Tend to carry sharp knives....
 First get their permission, my lord!         (U)

 A lusty old Duke, at Estrella
 Was behaving in ways I won't say-a
 In his BVDs
 Duct-taped to a tree
 He woke up the very next day-a!              (I)

 Treat ladies as tho' sacramental
 Unless their bare arms,
 Loose behavior, and charms

 Who cockily entered the lists
 A Duke soon uncocked him,

 Delighted to wallow in smut!
 They use dirty socks

 The cracks in the sky caused me fright!
 Pieces came down!

 But Man spoiled his chances by sinning
 We trust that the story

 But, at present, the Other side's winning....     (T)

 Of this song about Terrible Sin
 And if you've been bored
 I'm sorry, m'lord
 You should NEVER have let me begin!         (I)

 "But I still have the box that it came in!"    (U)

 A Cavalier lady named Mabel
 Once said, "I don't think that I'm able,
 But I'm willing to try
 So where shall I lie?
 On the bed, on the floor, or the table?"       (U)

 T'was a randy young wench down in Dover
 Whose passion was such that it drove her
 To cry when you came
 "Oh dear! What a shame!
 Methinks that we'll have to start over!"       (U)

 An Atlantian wierdo named Will
 Made his neighbors exceedingly ill
 When they learned of his habits
 Involving white rabbits
 And a bird with a flexible bill!               (U)

 A lascivious Scotsman from Neap
 Remarked as he ravished a sheep
 "I'm hoping I shall
 Someday hump a gal,
 But they're neither as tight, nor as cheap!"   (U)

         THE WESTMINISTER WHORE 
 (c. 1610) Found in "Bawdy Verse, A Pleasant Collection"   
                                                                     
  As I went to Westminister Abby
  I saw a younge Wenche on her backe,
  Cramminge in a Dildo of Tabby
  Into her Cunt Till 'twas ready to crack.

  "By your leave" said I, "Pretty Maid,
  Methinks your sport is but drye?"
  "I can get no better" she said; "Sir,
  And I'll tell you the reason why."

  "Madame P. hath a Thing at her breech,
  Sucks up all the scad of the Town;
  She's a damn'd lascivious Bitch
  And fucks for half-a-Crown."

  "Now, the Curse of a Cunt without Hair
  And ten thousand Poxes upon her;
  We pore whores may go hang in dispaire;
  We're undone by the Maydes of Honour."

  Then in Loyalty, as I was bound,
  Hering her speak in this sort.
  I fuckt her thrice on the ground,
  And bid her speak well of the Court.

               WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?
                     (Monty Python)

 Whenever life gets you down Mrs. Brown,
 And things seem hard or tough,
 And people are stupid, obnoxious, or daft,
 And you feel that you've had quite enough...

 Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving,
 And revolving at nine-hundred miles an hour.
 That's orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it's reckoned,
 A sun that is the source of all our power.

 The Sun, and you and me, and all the stars that we can see,
 Are moving at a million miles a day,
 In an outer spiral arm, at forty thousand miles an hour,
 Of the galaxy we call the Milky Way.

 Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars,
 It's one hundred thousand light years side to side.
 It bulges in the middle, sixteen thousand light years thick,
 But out by us it's just three thousand light years wide.

 We're thirty thousand light years from galactic central point,
 We go round every two hundred million years,
 And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions (and billions...)
 In this amazing and expanding universe.

 The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
 In all of the directions it can whiz.
 As fast as it can go, the speed of light you know,
 Twelve million miles a minute, and that's the fastest speed there is.

 So remember when you're feeling very small and insecure,
 How amazingly unlikely is your birth,
 And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space,
 Because there's bugger all down here on earth.

                YOUNG FOLKS, OLD FOLKS
                          -Traditional

CHORUS: Young folks, old folks, everybody come
        Come to the Sunday School and have a lot of fun
        Bring a stick of chewing gum and park it at the door
        (Please check your chewing gum and razors at the door)
        And we'll tell you Bible stories like you never heard before!

  God made the world in six days and rested on the seventh
  According to the contract, it should have been the eleventh
  But the carpenters were out on strike, the masons wouldn't work
  So the foremen dug a hole and they filled it up with dirt

  When they finished with the firmament they started on the sky
  They hung it overhead and they left it there to dry
  They studded it with stars made of pretty angel's eyes
  To give us a little light when the moon forgot to rise

  God made Satan, Satan made sin
  God made a hot place to put Satan in
  Satan didn't like it so he said he wouldn't stay
  He's been acting like the devil ever since that very day!

  Adam was the first man that ever was invented
  Along came Eve, and then he was contented
  Then came the Serpent, knocking at the door
  Eve et the apple, and Adam et the core!

  Adam was a gardener and Eve, she was his spouse
  They got the sack for stealing fruit and went to keeping house
  They lived a very quiet life, and peaceful in the main
  Until they had a baby and they started raising Cain!

  Adam was the first man, we all do believe
  He had a wife and her name was Eve
  She was fair to look upon, and oh how she could dance
  And her dress was made of shredded wheat, and so were Adam's pants

  Adam had two sons who didn't quite agree
  The psychiatrists they conferred and said " 'Twas sibling rivalry!"
  One day young Cain got angry, and somehow lost his head
  Took out his Colt revolver and filled Abel full of lead!

  Noah was a mariner and sailed around the sea
  With half a dozen wives and a whole menagerie
  He tried his hand a fishing so the Bible tale confirms
  But he didn't have much luck 'cause he only had two worms!

  Methuselah was crabby 'cause he couldn't take a joke
  He had all the makings of an old and seedy bloke
  His whiskers got so long that he couldn't see ahead
  If he'd tucked in all the covers he could have used them for his bed!

  Methuselah got famous, for he refused to die
  "When ya gonna croak?" they asked, he answered, "Bye and bye!"
  And when they pressed him for the date, Methuzy whispered "Hush!"
  Then laughing thru his whiskers, he hollered "What's the rush?"

  Esau was a cowboy, a wild and wooly rake
  Half the ranch belonged to him, and half to brother Jake
  Now Esau thought the title to the property weren't clear
  So he sold out to his brother for a sandwich and a beer

  Onan, son of Judah, was a melancholy kid;
  He'd jerk and jerk and jerk and jerk, and that was all he did.
  But the Lord got angry, when Onan shunned his mate
  So awfully hipped on self-abuse, he wouldn't fornicate!

  Joseph was a shepherd and he kept his father's goats
  His Daddy used to dress him in the very loudest coats
  His brothers they got jealous and they threw him in a well
  Joseph went to Heaven and the others went to -----  

  Joseph was a pretty boy, a very handsome kid
  His boss' wife she eyed him, and straight'way flipped her lid
  She grabbed him by his you-know-what, and sat him on her lap
  But Joey wouldn't fall for that - he knew she had the clap!

  Moses was a prophet, they found him by a brook
  He was found by Pharaoh's daughter when she went in for a look
  She took him home to Father, said she found him by the shore
  Pharaoh merely smiled and said "I've heard that one before!"

  Moses was a wise old bird who knew some fancy tricks
  The 'gyppos tried some phoney stuff with magic walking sticks
  Old Pharoah he pursued him, and the Israelites did flee
  But Moses hexed the army, and drowned 'em in the sea!

  Moses was the leader of the Israelitic flock,
  He used to get spa water just by tapping on a rock.
  But then, from the multitude there came a mighty cheer,
  For instead of getting water, he got Foster's Lager beer!

  Joshua was a jazz cat - the greatest ever born
  The wall of Jericho fell down when he blew on his horn
  Pursuing all his enemies, he made the sun stand still
  The sun it wouldn't listen, so he nailed it to a hill!

  Here comes Ruth just looking all around
  Just like the girls in my home town
  Didn't wear any lipstick, or powder on her nose
  But she got a fella, as everybody knows!

  Meshach, Shadrach and Abednego
  Told the King of Babylon where he could go
  He put them in the furnace, and gave the door a slam
  But they wore asbestos BVD's and didn't give a....hoot

  Daniel was a stubborn man who wouldn't mind the King
  The King said he'd nver heard of such a naughty thing!
  Put Daniel in the lion's den, with Daniel underneath
  But Daniel was a dentist, and he pulled the lion's teeth!

  Salome was a dancer and she danced before the King
  She wiggled and she wobbled and she shook most everything
  "But" said the King, "We must have no scandal here!"
  "The hell we won't!" Salome said, and kicked the chandelier!

  Samson was a guy from the P.T. Barnum school
  He used to lift five hundred pounds as strongman in the show
  'Til a lady named Delilah got him all fixed up with gin
  They caught him bald-headed and the coppers ran him in!

  But Samson wasn't satisfied, the pace got in his hair
  He mooned around when the act was on and set himself a chair
  He'd slain ten thousand Philistines with the jawbone of a mouse
  But that weight-lift act of Samson's brought down the house!

  Solomon was a wise man, he had a lot of cash
  Queen of Sheba came along, and Solly made a mash
  I guess he thought that royalty was rather underpaid
  For he took to writing proverbs, tho he was a King by trade!

  Jeremiah was a wailer who cried both night and day
  He bawled and bawled just bucketsful, and cried his eyes away
  They asked him "Whatcha cryin' for?" He grabbed a handkerchief
  "The worst, dear friends, has happened: my pecker won't get stiff!"

  Elijah was an astronaut, a very clever flyer
  He winged up to heaven in a chariot of fire
  But when he reached the Pearly Gates, the Lord began to frown;
  "Now listen here, Elijah, just haul those cinders down!"

  Elijah was a prophet and he worked the County Fairs
  He advertised his act with a set of dancing bears
  He held a sale of prophecies 'most every afternoon
  And he went up every evening in a gaudy silk balloon

  Ahab had a lovely wife, her name was Jezebel
  While hanging out the clothes one day, down off the roof she fell
  "Your wife has gone all to the dogs," was what they told the King
  But Ahab said he'd never heard of such a doggone thing!

  Jonah was an emigrant, so runs the Bible tale
  He took a steerage passage on a transatlantic whale
  Jonah in the belly of the whale felt quite compressed
  So he pushed a little button and the whale did the rest!

  Goliath was a giant, and he was a rowdy cuss
  Went around the countryside, looking for a fuss
  When he saw David, he laughed till he bust
  Then David heaved a rock and socked him on the crust!

  John was a Baptist, whose look was hot as fire
  He took one look at Salome and filled her with desire
  She propositioned Johnny, but he wouldn't go to bed
  So Johnny lost that piece of tail, and also lost his head!

  Paul was a salesman who travelled far and wide
  But tho he was a bachelor, he never went for hide
  He scorned every female, and preached that sex was out
  And 'twas all because Paul's peter was afflicted with the gout!

  There are plenty of these Bible tales, I'll tell you more tomorrow
  How Lot with the wife and family fled from Sodom and Gomorrah
  But his wife turned to salt, to her very great dismay
  And Lot moved out to the suburbs of L.A.!

  Cain was a wicked man because he slew his brother
  Samson was a strong man, Noah built the Ark
  Jonah was a fisherman got swallered by a shark

  They started in the Garden, together keeping house
  All was going pretty well, until the baby came
  And then they started in a-raising Cain!

  Stumbled on a hammer, and built himself an Ark
  The rain came down in showers fine

  He failed the first season when it rained for forty days
  In that knd of weather, a circus never pays!

  He spent three days in the belly of a whale
  Jonah got bored, and the whale got depressed
  So Jonah pushed the button and the whale did the rest
