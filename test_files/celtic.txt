 Hi said the Norn, sittin in the sand          Chorus: hi diddle i diddle i day 

 once I talked to a great Grey Man             hi diddle i diddle i diddle ay 
 spun three times and said with a sigh         hi di diddle i diddle i day 
 hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!  fol the dink a dum diddle do  
                                                                     di day 
 
 Hi said the Lady, dressed in green       The Circle forms, the Circle flows 
 prettiest thing I've ever seen           the Circle goes where no man knows 
 she went down underneath the hill        Hail to the Lady, one in three:    
 and came back out of her own free will   Present is Past and Past is Me!    
                                                                             
 Brian Boru, on Irish ground              Hi said the Lady dressed in white  
 walked three times the Island round      sang the Day and sang the Night    
 Norsemen came lookin for a fight         sang the Land and sang the Sea     
 just another Irish Saturday night!       sang the Song, and then sang Me!   
                                                                             
 Hi said Lugh on the banquet night           Salt and oil and mirror bright  
 a poet and a player and a good wheelwright  fire and fleet and candlelight  
 a harper and a warrior and none the least:  by fin and feather, leaf and tree, 

 a Druid and he got in to the Feast!         fill the cup and blessed be!  
 
 Harold Haardrada's face was red!         From the misty crystal sea       
 Came to Britain and he wound up dead     Came the Lady to the lea         
 Stamford Bridge is where he's found      Sword and Roses in Her Hand      
 got six feet of English ground           Spread their seeds thruout the Land  
 
 the Legion with it's Eagles bright       Came the Stag from oaken wood        
 marched into the Pictish night           saw the Lady where she stood      
 met them there upon the sand             by the fire burning bright        
 gave em up to the Wicker Man!            came to know his heart's delight! 
 
 eight-legged steed and hound of Hel      By Sword and Harp, and Irish Hound  
 the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well       Blessed Be: the Day I've found     
 fire burn and fire spark                 Hail to the Lady, one in Three     
 are you then feared of the dark?         Present is Past and Past is WE     
                                                                             
 Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight     By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn      
 all thru the Day all thru the Night      Blessed be the Day you're born!    
 Hail to the Lady, one in Three           Fire burn and fire bright          
 Present is Past and Past is Thee!        walk in safety thru the night      
                                (end)
