Someone, (sorry I don't remember who) asked if anyone had written
anything as a tribute to Isaac Asimov.  I wrote this one the night
I heard he had died.  I think it's fitting as he was the reason
I was inspired to write Shakespearean Sonnets as acrostics.  This
one's for Isaac!



          Somewhere around my fourteenth year or so

          Conveniently I cannot be precise

          I came upon a friend at school and though

          Exteriors diverse, we shared a vice.

          No one could have forseen the coming change

          Content were we to sit upon our duff

          Even then we knew that we were strange
     
          For girls to like to read that "awful stuff"

          I loved imagining huge ships in space

          Considered what strange worlds would be "out there"

          Toward the stars I soared while in that place

          Inside the magazines, "amazing", "weird".

               Of all the writers I'm enamored of

               No one can equal Isaac Asimov

In Memoriam to Isaac Asimov, Science Fiction Writer par
excellence.
