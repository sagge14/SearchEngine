From the Seattle Times:

"I haven't felt excitment in listening to as well as creating music.... for
too many years now.  I fell guilty beyond wordsa for these things.   "The fact
is, I can't fool you, any of you.  It simply isn't fair to you or me.  The
worst crime I can think of would be to put people off by faking it and
pretending as if I was having 100-per-cent fun.    "Sometimes I feel as if I
should have a punch in time clock before I walk out on stage.  I've tried
everything within my power to appreciate it, and I do.  God, beleive me, I do.
But its not enough.  I appreciate the fact that I--we--have affected and
entertained a lot of people.    "I must be one of those narcissists who only
enjoy things when they're alone.  I'm too sensitive.  Oh, I need to be
slightly numb in order to  regain the enthusiasm I once had as a child.    On
our last three tours, I had a lot much better appreciation of all the people
I've known personally and of fans of our music.  But I still can't get out the
frustration, the guilt and the empathy I have for everybody.
    "There is good in all of us, and I simply love people too much.  So much
that it makes me feel too....sad.     "And I had it good, very good.  I'm
grateful.  But since the age of seven, I've become hateful toward all humans
in general...only because I love and feel for people too much, I guess.  I
thank all of
you from the pit of my burning, nauceous stomach for your letters and concern
during the last years.  I'm too much of an erratic moody person that I don't
have the passion anymore.  So remember, it's better to burn out than fade
away.
   "Peace, love and empathy."
                                           Kurt Cobain

 What was the last thing Kurt said before his face got blown away?

 "Shit, I thought this was a microphone!"
 OR
 "Is this mike on?"


-maybe he was actually listening to one of his recordings and decided it
 was so bad that a .22 was the only cure??? hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

 This doesn't fit with the net consensus so far that he was listening to
 one of his recordings and decided that it was even worse---so bad in fact
 that a SHOTGUN was the only cure... not a .22.


 BTW, anybody have a spare copy of the suicide note, I wanna make it
 into a song.

 Or you could follow what a Quebec public school teacher did with the
 demented and apparently gramatically flawedd suicide note of Marc Lepine,
 the famous Ecole Polytechnique gunman and make it a grammar exercise for
 your students.


 Hey, man. Think about Dave Grohl! What's he gonna do? He ain't
 got shit now! Think about it! He's a drummer, man. There's

 Who the fuck wants a bassist? Think about him, like applying to
 be the bassist for the Flaming Lips or some bullshit. You think
 they'll pay them what he got in Nirvana? I don't think so, man!

 At least Krist can like write a book or something. But Dave,
 man, he's fucked! He knew Kurt like 3 months or something. He's
 ugly, he's untalented, he's stupid, he sucks! He dresses like

 be lucky to be working Arby's, man!
