For those of you who make Crystal ("smack", "meth") on the West 
Coast or that general vicinity, beware trying to set up a market 
without letting the "bikers" know.

In the west, California in particualr, the meth market is monopolized
by "bikers" and anyone producing meth without thier knowledge is risking
quite a bit of wrath... anyone SELLING meth independently is risking death.
So the advice is:  If you make meth, tell the bikers.

The real advice is: Don't make meth.  According to the California Narcotics
Police, 90% of all meth labs are discovered when they explode.

However, good news for other chemists!  99% of all Narcotics lab-busting is
geared towards Meth and other amphetamines.  Labs that produce psychedelics
are safer today than ever.
