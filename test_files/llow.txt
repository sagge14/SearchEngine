THE MILWAUKEE BALLAD by Paul Matte and Bob
            Hirschfeld)
(to the tune of The Irish Ballad)
 
About a man I'll sing a song,
Sing rickety-tickety-tin
About a man I'll sing a song,
Who didn't keep his lovers long
Not only did he do them wrong
He did every one of them in, them in,
Jeffrey Dahmer did all of them in.
 
One evening in a fit of pique,
Sing rickety-tickety-tin
One evening in a fit of pique,
he dropped some body parts-in-the-creek
The water tasted bad for a week,
And he had to make do with gin, with gin,
he had to make do with gin.
 
He boiled his victim down to bones,
Sing rickity-tickity-tin
He boiled his victims down to bones,
And used them then to spread on scones,
All they ever found were some bones,
And occasional pieces of skin, of skin,
Occasional pieces of skin.
 
One day when he had nothing to do,
Sing rickity-tickity-tin
One day when he had nothing to do,
he cut an Asian boy in two
And served him up as an Irish Stew,
And invited the neighbors
bors in, bors in,
Invited the neighbors in.
 
And when at last the police came by,
Sing rickity-tickity-tin
And when at last the police came by,
his little pranks he did not deny
But the cops handed back the child, oh my!
So that Dahmer could slaughter agin, agin,
So that Dahmer could slaughter agin.
 
My tragic tale I won't prolong,
Sing rickity-tickity-tawn
My tragic tale I won't prolong,
And if you do not enjoy my song,
Blame Milwaukee Police,
if he killed too long,
Homophobia let it go on, go on,
homophobia let it go on.
