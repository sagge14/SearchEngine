(1)     Oh the Ball, the Ball of Ballyknure
        Where your wife, and my wife, were doin' it on the floor!

        (chorus) Wha' do ya, lassie?
                 and wha' do y'noo?
                 I'm the man what did y'last, lass,
                 I canna do y'noo!

        The Queen was in the parlour, eatin bread and honey
        The King was in the chambermaid, and she was in the money!

        The village idiot he was there, a-sittin' by the fire
        Attempting masturbation with an india-rubber tyre!

        Oh, the village postman he was there, but he had the Pox
        He couldna' do the ladies so he did the letter-box!

        The Queen of England she was there, backed against the wall
        "Put yer money on the table, boys, I'm going ta do you all!"

        The Count and Countess, they were there, a-doin' on the stair
        The bannister broke, and down they fell, they finished in mid-air!

        There was music in the garden, there was music in the sticks
        You couldna' hear the music for the swishin' o' the pricks!

        They were doin' it on the landing, they were doin' it on the stairs
        You couldna' see the carpet for the wealth of pubic hairs!

        The Kingdom Herald, he was there, whattya think o'that?
        Blazoning positions wi' a Duchess and a cat!

(10)    The fubba-wubbas they were there, sittin' all alone
        Complainin of the doin's with loud and piercing moans!

        Mr. Jameison he was there, the one that fought the Boers
        He jumped up on the table and he shouted for the hoors!

        The Board of Directors they were there, and they were shocked to see
        Four-and-twenty maidenheads a-hangin' from a tree!

        John the Blacksmith he was there, he wouldna play the game
        He did a lassie seven times, but wouldna see her hame!

        The village Constable he was there, now whattya think o'that?
        Amusin' himself by abusin' himself, and catchin' it in his hat...

        Ball of Ballyknure (cont.)

        It started out so simple-like: each lad and lassie mated
        But pretty soon the doin's got so bloody complicated!

        Four and twenty virgins came down from Cuinimore
        Only two got back again, and they were double-bore!

        Clan MacChluarain, they were there, sleepin in the shade
        For no one could decide if they were Man, or Sheep, or Maid!

        The village pervert he was there, scratchin' at his crotch
        But no one minded him at all, he was only there to watch!

        The Kingdom Seneshal was there, linin' 'em up in rows
        He didna use his pecker, lads, he did 'em with his toes!

(20)    The village cripple he was there, but he didna shag too much
        His old John Thomas had fallen off, so he did 'em with his crutch!

        The old schoolteacher he was there, he diddled by rule-of-thumb
        workin' logarithmicly the times that he would come!

        The village chimney-sweep was there, a really filthy brute
        For every time he farted, he covered 'em all with soot!

        The local Cavaliers were there, in elegance they sat
        A-doin' Things Unusual with the feathers in their hat!

        The Rapier-fighters they were there, doin' what they could
        A-thrustin' and a-parryin' with Real Steel, not with wood!

        The local Hordesmen they were there, busier than bees
        the ladies wouldna have 'em, so they diddled dogs and trees!

        The village carpenter he was there, with his prick of wood
        He made it when he lost his own, and it worked just as good!

        The shenai-fighters they were there, all wrapped up in smiles
        A-doin' everyone they could in Oriental style!

        The College of Heralds they were there, in the other room
        Arguin' about who would do what, with which, to whom!

        The rattan-jocks were out in force and they were such a sight
        They didna do the ladies 'cause they'd heard there was a fight!

(30)    The old fishmonger he was there, a dirty stinkin sod
        He never got a rise that night, so he diddled 'em with a cod!

        The Kingdom Laurels they were there, and quite a sight to see
        A-doin' everyone they could, and most artisticly!

        The Kingdom Pelicans were there, doin' it with a sob
        They diddled out of duty; it was just another job!

        Four and twenty virgins went down to Inverness
        And when the Ball was over, there were four and twenty less!

        There was doin's on the porches, and doin's on the stones
        You couldna' hear the music for the loud and joyful moans!

        (insert name) he was there, covered up with smiles
        Doin' thirty-two at once, and in amazing style!

        All the Kingdom spodes were there, but they just sat and sulked
        For this was the occasion that no one told them "Get fulked!"

        Clan MacChluarain they were there, chasin' round the Keep
        And every single man of them buggerin' a sheep!

        (insert name) had a gerbil, he diddled it very well
        He didn't wrap it in duct tape: he blew it all to hell!

        (insert name) he was there, with his favourite toys:
        A dozen beautiful women, and a dozen beautiful boys!

(40)    (insert name) he was there; he wasn't very nice
        He didna do the ladies, he did gerbils, rats and mice!

        (insert name) she was there, covered all in sweat,
        Takin' on all comers, and she hasn't finished yet!

        The Dark Horde carried her away, and we ain't found her yet!

        The Locksley Monsters they were there, lookin' for some nookie
        But they got distracted by a chocolate chippie cookie!

        (insert name) he was there, a crafty friend of Ghengis,
        He speaks a lot of languages; he is a cunning linguist!

        The village Masochist, he was there, beggin' for some blows
        The Sadist merely looked at him, and softly answered "No!"

        Yang the Nauseating was sittin' out in back
        The ladies did na' want him for he smelled too much of yak!

        The village druggist he was there, grinnin' like a fox
        He'd sold out of condoms, so he sold 'em dirty socks!

        Buell the Kind was also there, that beggar meek and mild,
        He didna' do the ladies, he had brought his favourite child!

        (insert name) he was there at the revel feast
        He doesn't like the girls, and the boys call him "The Beast!"

(50)    And in the morning, early, the Farmer nearly shat
        For four and twenty acres was nearly fuckit flat!

        It was a grand old party, lads, and sure a Locksley Plot
        And every lad and lassie there was glad of what they got!

        And when the Ball was over, everyone confessed
        The music it was wonderful, but the "doin's" were the best!

        Good Sir <insert name> was there, white belt across his mid
        When the ladies saw him coming, they all ran off and hid

        <insert title> <insert name> was there, brass hat upon his head
        His ancient bones let out such groans we thought he'd wake the dead

        Good Sir <insert name> was there, with spurs upon his heels
        Showing the gals how to please their pals and suffocate trouser eels

        Master <insert name> was there, white baldric 'cross his chest
        Making no "pax" with Castle Anthrax and it's "peril" from Python's quest

        (insert name) he was there, playin' fast and loose
        Doin' an innocent gerbil, and wishin' it was a moose!

      (note: This may not be ALL the verses, but it's doggone close!)
