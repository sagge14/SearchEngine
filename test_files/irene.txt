Conclusion: Every traditional Hootenanny ends with Good Night Irene:
 
GOODNIGHT IRENE
 
     Chorus:
     Irene, good ni-i-ight
     Irene, good night
     Good night, Irene.  Good night, Irene.
     I'll see you in my dreams
 
Have we sung enough folk songs to suit ya?
Of folk songs have we sung enough?
Can the ACLU now recruit ya?
If you don't like our show, well, that's
tough!
 
     Chorus and singalong:
 
Civil Liberties are worth defending
Civil Liberties: that's why we're here
Civil Liberties: effort worth spending
So we'll see you the same time, next year.
 
     Chorus and singalong:
 
Sometimes we are fighting the Congress
Sometimes the local police
Sometimes we're fighting the censors
To protect our cherished beliefs
 
     Chorus and singalong:
 
Sometimes it's the First Amendment
Sometimes we're defending pot
Sometimes we defend the right of those
To sit on the pavement and rot
 
     Chorus and singalong:
 
Every good show has an ending
And this one was good, don't you think?
Now homeward our friends are wending
If they didn't have too much to drink.
 
     Chorus and singlalong:
 
     Irene, good ni-i-ight
     Irene, good night
     Good night, Irene, good night, Irene,
     I'll see you in my dreams.
