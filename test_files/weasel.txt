****************** BEN WEASEL SKATE REPORT *****************
******************************************* BY BEN WEASEL **


REPULSE KAVA - 7"  (Butt Rag Records) Appropriate label, this 
is a shitty sounding record from a shitty sounding band.

8th  ROUTE  ARMY  - "Chernobyl Cookbook"  LP  (1  Dimensional 
Records)  Clockwork Orange fans take note - the singer  calls 
himself Johnny Zhivago.  Unfortunately, that's the only thing 
worth noting about this disc.   Most of the lyrics don't make 
sense,  one  of the few exceptions being "All Dead Radio,"  a 
tirade  against commercial rock stations which would be  much 
more  effective if the band didn't sound like a cross between 
Greg Kihn and The Knack.

WRECKING  CREW  - "Balance Of Terror" LP   (Hawker)   Christ, 
this is horrible!  It's pretty obvious that whoever puts  out 
these  records is interested in "moving units:  cause if good 
music were a factor (as opposed to a tough-sounding name  and 
a  marketable NY Mosh Crue attitude)  shit like this would be 
back  in  some bald kid's parents' garage where  it  belongs. 
Metal  mosh-o-rama with constipated Randy "Macho Man"  Savage 
vocals.

CRUCIAL  YOUTH "The Posi Machine" (New Red Archives) The only 
straight edge band in the world. Ray 2Day is a festering sore 
on  a  meat-eating junkie bum's rotting  pwnis  compared   to 
these  straight & clean boys.   Not content with pushing  the 
obvious  straight  edge themes,  Crucial Youth confronts  the 
scene with commentary on issues such as proper dental hygiene 
and  healthy eating habits,  as well as stern warnings  about 
the dangers of jay walking and masturbation.  Hopefully, some 
of those other so-called "positive" bands will listen to this 
record and mend their ways.

NO  FOR AN ANSWER "A Thought Crusade" LP (Hawker)   For  kids 
who  didn't make the school football team.  Every song sounds 
like a Kermit/Fozzie Bear hybrid.  Utterly  ridiculous.  What 
these guys need is some good dope.

********************** LIVE *********************************

GORILLA  BISCUITS/SICK  OF IT ALL/RAW  DEAL/LAUGHING  HYENAS/ 
SCREECHING  WEASEL/SPONGE  TUNNEL  - U.  of Conn  at  Storrs, 
12-10-88
     Never  having  seen a real live New York  Straight  Edge 
band before,  I was tickled pink at the thought of sharing  a 
bill  with  a  couple  of "the scene's" up  and  coming  s.e. 
outfits.   Spongetunnel  and  the Weasels  played  first  and 
nobody  gave a fuck.   Laughing Hyenas put on a killer  show, 
they were tight as hell and the singer (ex-Negative Approach) 
was  screaming  so loud that the p.a.  exploded and sent  500 
pounds of shredded sound equipment hurtling through the  hall 
at the speed of light,  disemboweling and castrating the 200+ 
crowd  of  crewcutted  pipsqueaks.    Actually,  what  really 
happened  was about 20 people got into the band and the  rest 
of   the  kiddies  stood  around  and  admired  each   others 
sweatshirts.  Raw  Deal  from Boston came on and played  fast 
music with slow mosh parts which the crowd adored. Sick Of It 
All  were introduced by some gangbanger type and  then  their 
NBA  coach  singer came up and ordered the crowd to "get  the 
fuck  up here and mosh - NOW!  We came all the way  from  New 
York!"   (A  grueling 2 hour ride in my estimation...we  were 
there on tour from Chicago.)  Needless to say,  the crowd did 
what  they were told and the band sucked mud.   But we  still 
walked away with a nice chunk of the nitwits' money.  Oh, and 
Gorilla  Biscuits never showed up,  they couldn't find  their 
drummer.  Howzat for unity?
