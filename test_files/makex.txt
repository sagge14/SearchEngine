This formula is exemplified for MDA (3,4-Methylenedioxy-
phenylisopropylamine); substituting N-methyl formamide
results in MDMA or N-methyl MDA (Ecstacy).
 
To a cooled mixture of 34 g 30% H2O2 and 150 g formic acid, add
dropwise a solution of 32.4 g (0.2M) isosafrole in 120 ml acetone,
(keep temperature below 30 degrees)  Let stand twelve hours and 
evacuate in vacuum.  Add 60 ml methanol and 369 g 15% sulfuric
acid to the residue and heat on a water bath three hours.  Cool,
extract with ether or benzene and evaporate in vacuum the extract
to give 20 g 3,4,-methylenedioxybenzylmethyl ketone.
  
Add 23 g of above ketone to 65 g formamide and heat at 190 degrees
for five hours.  Cool, add 100 ml H2o2, extract with benzene and
evaporate in vacuum the extract.  Add 8 ml methanol and 57 ml 15%
HCL to residue, heat on water bath two hours and evaporate in
vacuum (or basify with KOH and extract the oil with benzene and dry,
evaporate in vacuum) to get 11.7 g MDA.
 
The above occurs as a yellowish brown oil;  this is active orally,
but somewhat inconvenient; to convert to powder (salt) form, reflux
in Hydrochloric acid and evaporate.
 
Safrole, an allyl benzene, occurs naturally in oil of sassafras,
about 70%. Can be extracted with simple distillation. It is con-
verted to isosafrole (a propenyl benzene) by adding equal weight
of KOH flakes and absolute ethanol and heating on steam bath or 
refluxing for 24 hours; dried and evaporated in vacuum or added
with two time its volume in water and extracted with ether or
methylene chloride and dried, evaporated in vacuum.  Hexane is used
for recrystalization.
 
Formamide and N-methyl formamide are closely watched by the DEA.
Many people have been busted by small suppliers where it was easy
to get; those are "sting" operations that tail the buyer home.
