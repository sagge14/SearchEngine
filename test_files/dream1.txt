             (Tune: "Strangest Dream")

     Last night you had the strangest dream
     The strangest dream of all
     You dreamed about a chicken that
     Was thirty-six feet tall

     It wrestled over Tokyo
     With Godzilla and the rest
     And in three falls, with overtime,
     It proved it was the best

     It then put on silk stockings
     And a leather garter belt
     And did impossible sexual things;
     You told me how it felt.

     Last night you had the strangest dream
     It made me quite annoyed;
     Don't tell me again what you dreamed last night 
     For I've been reading Freud!

My mind is going ..... I can feel it .... I can feel it ..... Dave .....

A VOICE: Dave's not here!

Oh ....
