 Down the road from where I live's a little diner 
 And some friendly foreign folks serve up the meal 
 Right behind the doggie pound is where it can be found 
 And the prices are so cheap, it is a steal! 
 
 CHORUS: Dog soup! It really -is- delicious 
         Dog soup! If you really are ambitious 
         You can eat a bowl or two 
         Take some home for Grandma too! 
         It's exotic foreign food, -and- inexpensive! 
 
 Take some noodles and some carrots and some onions 
 Take some spices and some other odds and ends 
 Then go into your neighborhood, find a doggie that looks good 
 And make soup out of Man's Best Friend! 
 
 Now cats tend to be a little stringy 
 And eating children gets you talked about 
 But if you wanna be in clover, tell ol' Rover to come over! 
 And then go dining out!
