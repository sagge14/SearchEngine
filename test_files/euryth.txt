What's that code?

I've done all I could, to find out what to do,
I'm out of ideas, I can't find something new,
My password's useless, They've changed it around on me,
I've done all I could, If I knew what to do I would.....

If I knew one thing, Just one thing,
If I knew one thing, Then I would know what to do....

What's that code,that I've been looking for, tell me,
What's that code,that I've been looking for, tell me,
What's that code?

The Password I used, has gone Invalidate,
I need that info, I've really got Irate,
The college mainframe, has made a password change,
I will call a BBS and find out what that needed password is,

What's that code, that I've been looking for, tell me,
What's that code, that I've been looking for, tell me,

If I knew one thing, Just one thing,
If I knew one thing, woh-oh..

Tell me, Tell me,

What's that code, That I've been looking for, tell me,	<Repeat 7>
