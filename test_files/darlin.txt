MY DARLIN' CHARLIE K by Bob Hirschfeld and
            Kate Searle (to the tune of My
            Darlin Clementine)
 
In a suite in the Phoenician
Living high upon the hog
Dwelt a Keating, fortune fleeting,
Continental's demagogue.
 
     Chorus:
 
     Oh my savings, oh my savings,
     oh my savings, Charlie K
     They are lost and gone forever
     You'll be sorry, Charlie K
 
From Columbus in Ohio
Stopping smut was what he'd sworn
Though the Citizens were Decent,
What he did to them was porn.
 
     Chorus (Singalong):
 
     Oh my savings, oh my savings,
     oh my savings, Charlie K
     They are lost and gone forever
     You'll be sorry, Charlie K
 
He developed and he financed,
Every cent they had, he sunk
Little ladies in their eighties
Found his bonds were made of junk.
 
     Chorus (Singalong):
 
     Oh my savings, oh my savings,
     oh my savings, Charlie K
     They are lost and gone forever
     You'll be sorry, Charlie K
 
Regulators, 'vestigators,
Said the rules, he couldn't bend
Charlie Keating, help was needing,
Bought a favor from his friends.
 
     Chorus (Singalong):
 
     Oh my savings, oh my savings,
     oh my savings, Charlie K
     They are lost and gone forever
     You'll be sorry, Charlie K
 
So they hauled him to the courtroom,
Charged him more than forty-nine
Swindlin' money, 'tisn't funny,
That's why Charlie's doing time.
 
     Chorus (Singalong):
 
     Oh my savings, oh my savings,
     oh my savings, Charlie K
     They are lost and gone forever
     You'll be sorry, Charlie K
