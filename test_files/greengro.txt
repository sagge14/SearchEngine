Subj: Green Grow the Rushes Oh!

Now that I've found the words for this, I thought I'd share it with other 
people, so that they can avoid the (admittedly slight) hassle I went through 
to find them.  If you don't know the tune to the original "Green Grow the 
Rushes", which is a biblical mnemonic (12 for the 12 apostles, 10 for the 10 
commandments, etc) with one odd seemingly pagan verse: "Two, two, the lily-
white boys covered all in green-oh", I'll post it in my ASCII notation. 

I'll sing you one, oh 
    GREEN GROW THE RUSHES OH! 
    AND WHAT IS YOUR ONE, OH? 
One is one and all alone and ever more shall be so. 

I'll sing you two, oh 
    GREEN GROW THE RUSHES OH! 
    AND WHAT IS YOUR TWO, OH? 
Two, two, the two-faced God in gold and red and green-oh, 
One is one and all alone, and ever more shall be so. 

I'll sing you three, oh 
    GREEN GROW THE RUSHES OH! 
    AND WHAT IS YOUR THREE, OH? 
Three, the Triple Goddess,
Two, two, the two-faced God in gold and red and green, oh,
One is one and all alone, and ever more shall be so. 

... 

I'll sing you thirteen, oh 
    GREEN GROW THE RUSHES OH! 
    AND WHAT IS YOUR THIRTEEN, OH? 
Thirteen rounds of the silvery wheel,
Twelve for the heavenly augurs, 
One and one for the Year-King's reign,
Ten for the Celtic Reading,
Nine for the nine-foot circle,
Eight for the eight great Sabbats,
Seven for the Gates between the Worlds,
Six for the Book of Changes
Five for the fiery points of light,
Four for the Guardian Towers.
Three, the Triple Goddess, 
Two, two, the two-faced God in gold and red and green, oh, 
One is one and all alone, and ever more shall be so.
