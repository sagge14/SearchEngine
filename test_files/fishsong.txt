                FISH SONGS 
                    -Joe Bethancourt

        (Tune: "Fish Heads") 
 
 CHORUS: Fish songs, Fish songs, lovely little Fish songs 
         Fish songs, Fish songs, eat them up, yum! 
 
 All about the holocaust, all about survival 
 All about living in outer space 
 
 All in A minor, then an E seventh 
 They are very complicated when they use G! 
 
 CHORUS 
 
 I took a Fish song to the local coffeehouse 
 They didn't understand it; I went away! 
 
 Anarchistic rabble-rousing roly-poly Fish songs 
 Not necessarily Politic'ly Correct! 
 
 CHORUS 
 
 Sing a Fish song; words by Rudyard Kipling 
 All in A minor, eat them up, yum! 
  
 CHORUS
