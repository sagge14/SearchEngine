This one was written in praise of the new Baron of SunDragon, Sir Arthur
O'Flaherty, who is an example of what a Knight -really should be-.

                THE GRIN BEHIND THE HELM
                        -Ioseph of Locksley
              (c) 1991 W.J. Bethancourt III
              (Tune: "Men Behind The Wire")

 CHORUS: Armored men in battle lines
         Dressed in shiny suits so fine
         Every fighter falls before 
         The "Grin Behind The Helm!"

 In the Barony SunDragon, on a quiet village street
 Lives a crazy Irish laddie and his lovely lady sweet
 Fighting man of bravest courage; smiling bright in battle's din
 All have learned to fear his coming; all have learned to fear his GRIN!

 In his lobster-tail and buff coat, velvet trousers edged with lace
 Arthur comes forth to do battle, with a grin upon his face!
 Vikings flee in grip of terror, Sassenach all climb a tree!
 Hark! The heralds shouting loudly: "Son of Erin, wild and free!"

 See the Shamrock there advances at the front of battle-line
 See the foeman flee before him, see them falling, nine times nine!
 Sun of Aten, shining brightly, shining star of Chivalry
 Son of Battle, Son of Honour, Son of Clan O'Flaherty!

                         *
