"Big Halls"
by Dave Roberts
Performed by Cthulhu and the Octoids


        I'm known in circles of perverse society,
        my gift is one of hallway notoriety.
        And while Star Spawn are not small,
        and their buildings are quite tall,
        I'm told that R'leh's got the biggest halls of all.

        I've got big halls,
        I've got big halls,
        I've got such big halls,
        And I've got big halls.
        He's got big halls,
        And she's got big halls,
        BUT WE'VE GOT THE BIGGEST HALLS OF THEM ALL!

        My halls are always teeming
        with chaotic mutant horrors;
        it's quite enough to make one lose one's mind.
        You can look on Alderbaron,
        Even search Nyogtha's lair,
        But these are just the biggest halls you'll find.

        <CHORUS>

        Some halls are made for twisting and
        some halls cannot be guessed,
        but halls in five dimensions are
        the halls that I like best.
        My halls are always teeming
        with octopoidal horror --
        The halls that aren't in R'leh are 
        the halls that are much poorer.

        <CHORUS>
