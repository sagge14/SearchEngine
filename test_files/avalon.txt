         AVALON IS RISING
         ----------------
          (C) 1985, 1987
words by Isaac Bonewitz, music trad. ("Babylon is Fallen")
 
 
Hail the day so long expected, when the Gates are opened wide.
Magicks old and new collected, have restored the ancient pride.
Throughout Faerie's wide dominion, hear teh trumptes swoor and soar--

Avalon is rising, is rising, is rising;   :
      Avalon is rising to fall no more.   : ---REPRISE
Avalon is rising, os rising;              :
      Avalon is rising to fall noi more!  :

All of us now stand in wonder, as our visions come to pass.
Earth Mother and God of Thunder, Hunter, Weaver, join the dance.
Swell the sound of joyous laughter, hear immortal voices roar:

REPRISE

THough some thought that all their hating, had sent Her beneath the waves;
Avalon was merely waiting, for Her folk will not be slaves!
Now the day of freedom's dawning, brings Them back forevermore--

REPRISE

Hark all ye in beds and bowers, Pan has come another time;
Ruling with a rod of flowers, giving us the bliss sublime.
Frigg and Frigga now shall guide us, Danu be our counselor--

REPRISE

Listen warriors of teh Old Gods as the Wild Hunt's horn doth sound;
All their works shall fall before us, and the evil ones be bound.
Raise the shield of bright AThena, swing the hammer of great Thor--

REPRISE

Hear me now each dree and bandree, brahman, volkhvi, flamen too;
Priest and priestess, poet, godi, runemaster and shaman true:
All your faith now is rewarded, prohpets of the ancient lore--

REPRISE

Some of us shall go a-sailing, through the void so deep and far.
They will come with us unfailing, plant the seeds from star to star.
Hear our children's children's voices, join with those from days of yore:

REPRISE
