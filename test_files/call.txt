   A CALL TO LORD AND LADY

   She lives and breathes upon the Earth
   Her wheel spins round the hub of June
   She is the web of life and birth
   Her smile floats softly with the moon

   Heart of life, and caring mother
   Loving sister, noble princess
   Firebird spirit, restless lover
   Shadowy hidden sorceress

   His strength is there in mountains high
   His lightning flys from air and cloud
   His horn heralds the wild hunt's ride
   He quickens forest, roaring proud

   Children's friend, protecting father
   Watchful brother, noble fighter
   Laughing wise one, dark magister
   Player of pipes, thoughtful sheperd

   Their faces many, countless names
   Pan, Diana, Zeus, Astarte
   Teachers from dreams, oracle's flames
   Speak, and guide us within our hearts
                    - J.A.B. 14 Feb 89
