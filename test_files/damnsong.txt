                 AND I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
                                                                                       By Lucillus
            Dedicated to the boys of Anglesea
        (Sung to the tune of "Greenback Dollar")
 
                                                                
                       CHORUS                                  
  And I don't give a damn about a-what you are thinkin',       
  It doesn't matter to me.                                     
  'Cause the only place where I feel at home                   
  Is with the boys of Anglesea, oh yeah,                       
  We are the boys of Anglesea.                                 
                                                               

Some people say I'm a drunkard,
Others say I'm no good,
But I'm just a natural born fightin' man
Doin' what I think I should, oh yeah,
The only thing at which I'm good.

When I first saw a Tuchuk
I thought that he looked pretty tough
But then we a-met them on the field
We found they were not so rough, oh yeah,
The SCA boys think that they're so tough.

When I was a little baby, 
My momma said, "Hey, son!
Travel where you will and grow to be a man,
But make damn sure to have some fun", oh yeah,
We're making sure to have some fun!

We don't care who we fight for
Just as long as we get to fight
And if you pay us our weight in beer
We'll think that maybe you're all right, oh yeah
'Cause we'll be drinking here all night.
