A piece of glass is fitted into the bottom of the stopper for the flask. To
that is placed an eight-inch length of rubber tubing and at the end of this is
the aerator. Two more pieces of glass is put in the top of the stopper.

First, you will need pure alcohol so buy some 100
proof vodka and distill it until you have about 12 oz.

Put the alcohol in the flask.Put about two inches of bleach and A teaspoon of
Sani-Flush in the chlorine bottle. This will generate the clorine gas that you
will need. Start the clorine through the alcohol while the flask is still
cold.
Watch it carefully to see when the alcohol stops absorbing the clorine. Then
light a alcohol lamp and place it under the 600 ml flask. Keep the flame low
until the alcohol stops absorbing again. Raise the flame and repeat. Continue
this untill the alcohol is boiling. Some of the alcohol will distill off into
the collection bottle. Several times during the process, pour this back into
the 600 ml beaker.

When the alcohol is totally chlorinated the flask is poured into a
porcelain dish and allowed to cool. If you have done this right the
cooled product should be a crystaline mass of unrefined Cloral Hydrate.

Now, pour strong sulfuric acid, three times the volume of the
Cloral Hydrate, into the pan. Place this pan on your stove over gentle
heat. When the cloral hydrate is melted, it and the sulfuric acid are
stirred throughly pour this into the flask and heat again. But this
time use the thermometer and don't let it get over 200 F.

As the mixture heats up, the still impure cloral hydrate will rise
to the surface. When it stops rising, use the basting syringe and draw
the top off of the sulfuric acid. Repeat this until the pan is empty.

Put the cloral hydrate (you drew it off in the last step) into the
beaker and heat at about 190 F. for 20 minutes. This will get rid of
any alcohol or acid still in it. Pour this back into the flask and add
an equal amount of sulfuric acid. Swirl this around to mix it.

Once again you must distill the mixture. But this time it is easy
since the cloral hydrate will boil at 210 F and the sulfuric acid boils
at 722 F. When finished pour out the acid, then wash and dry the flask.
Now, put the powered Calcium Oxide, equal in volume to the cloral
hydrate into the flask, add the cloral hydrate and distill again. Stop
as soon as the surface of the oxide is dry.


To use, add one part water to two parts { by volume } of the
finished product. The dose is 1/28th of an oz ( 1 gram ). The best way
to use this is to put it into a mixed drink, because it has abitter
taste. In about 15 minutes, whoever you gave it to is out for the night.
