DOUBLE DARE


I dare you, to be real,
to touch a flickering flame,
the pangs of dark delight
don't cower in night fright

Don't back away just yet
from destination set
I dare you to be proud
to dare to shout aloud
for convinctions that you feel
like sound from bells to peal
I dare you to speak of your despire
for beurocracy, hypocracy - all liars


IN THE FLAT FIELD

A gut pull drag on me
into the casm gaping we
mirrors multy reflecting this
between spunk stained sheet
and odorous whim
calmer eye-flick-shudder-within
assist me to walk away in sin
where is the string that Theseus laid
find me out this labyrinth place
I do get bored, I get bored
in the flat field

Yin and yang lumber punch
go taste a tart then eat my lunch
and force my slender thin and lean
in this solemn place of fill wetting dreams
of black matted lace of pregnant cows
as life maps out onto my brow
the card is lowered in index turn
into my filling cabinet hemispheres spurn

I do get bored, I get bored
in the flat field

Let me catch the slit of light
for a maidens sake
on a maiden flight
in the flat field I do get bored
replace with Piccadilly whores
in my yearn for some cerebral fix
transfer me to that solid plain
hammer me into blazed pain
moulding shapes no shame to waste
and drag me there with deafening haste



A GOD IN ALCOVE

Go and look for the dejected once proud
idol remembered in stone aloud
then on coins his face was mirrored
take a look it soon hath slithered
to a fractured marble slab
renunciation clad
his nourishiment extract from his subjects
that mass production profile

He's a God-in-in an alcove

Once he spread the rain
so they dreamt in vain
once he spread the wheat
had made garlands for his feet
until the lily poet of our times
horizoned on the line
love became the in theme then
opposing fakers thrice by ten
don't perceive his empty plea
that redundant effigy

He's a God-in-in an alcove

Take in view his empty stool
what's left in satin cool
clawing adornment for his crimes
they saw they had to draw the line
so they sent him far away
to a little alcove
all alone

He's a God, a God

Now I am silly
silly, silly, silly, silly


DIVE

We're going down
to the kamikazi dive

Fishnet leatherette
Pussy Galore
pseudo sumo wrestler
on the door
dangerous dances
the dragons claw
K-Tel oriental
the monkey's paw

You're a dead ringer
for Madame Butterfly
snappy little fingers
stitch my thigh
you're so necromantic
venomous and vain
mixing molotov cocktails
in the subterrain

We're going down
to the kamikazi dive
like insects in a Chinese lantern now
we're feeling so alive, what's showing?
We're going down
to the kamikazi dive
like manic moths in Chinese lanterns now
we're feeling so alive, what's showing?


THE SPY IN THE CAB

Hidden in the dashboard
the unseen mechanized eye
under surveylance
the road is full of cats eyes
it's sick function to pry
the spy in the cab

Coldly observing-calously reserving
a drivers time
automated autonomy
playing on his mind

the spy in the cab
The spy in the cab
An eye for an eye
a spy for an eye
an eye for an eye
a spy for a spy

A twenty four hour unblinking watch
installed to pry
installed to cop
the spy in the cab
I spy with my little eye


SMALL TALK STINKS

Small talk stinks
see the young man in his new gown
talking up to his boufant drag
he says he loves you with flowers
something that he's never had
a sentence should be like a serpent
quick with a sting in its tail
string me a line that has meaning and depth
there's no small talk with walky talkies
small talks stinks

I said it stinks
small talk stinks

You whisper sweet nothing
chit-chat back-chat
there's no idle gossip in brail
taking combs three times a day
twice an hour
identikit cute lips from wall to wall
stand in line for the photo call
see the young man in his new gown
talking up to his boufant drag
small talk stinks




ST. VITUS DANCE

Back in the good old days
when dancing meant exploding
the idea was simple
for a decent overloading
and for a multiple flash
with no chords attached
he came up with a more remote flash trigger
it's connected to an accessory in his hip
which automatically fires in perfect synchro
but perhaps his most exciting
development in his angle
they call it the dance
it's the St. Vitus dance
such flexibility
what an accessory
see his soft bounce
what flexibility
such a soft bounce
what an accessory

And for special effects he has six filters
three coloured red
with the others pilfered
and if you really want to know what that means
he could throw a blue flash
from eighty five feet
of course you might want
to check out your own little output
so we devised a few simple and easy
to crack contorsions
so you can bump and scrape
all the day through
with the dance, it's the St. Vitus dance
such flexibility, what an accessory
such a soft bounce
what flexibility, such a soft bounce
check his hot shoe, feel his output
he's a light machine, see his angle
he's a light machine


STIGMATA MARTYR

In a crucifixation ecstasy
lying cross chequed in agony
stigmata bleed continuously
holes in head, hands, feet,
and weep for me

Stigmata, oh you sordid sight
stigmata in your splintered plight
look to your crimson orifice
in holy remembrance
in scarlet bliss

Stigmata Martyr



NERVES

Nerve ends tick
in flicker book animation
one eye's closed in fear, anticipation
will it stay shut? Will it ever open?
What if?
Nerves!

Tell tale tongues
lick at seven senses
brittle spittle sparks
you are defenceless
the fabric of dreams is ripped apart
as you feel the twist
of the shadowed dagger
in your pumping heart

Nerves

Nerves like nylon, nerves like steel

A trail of random cutlery cuts a dash
in the concrete underpass
sense of serenity is shattered
in the glint of splintered glass

Nerves

Nerves like nylon, nerves like steel



HAIR OF THE DOG

The man who was mortally wonded in war
kept on fighting
the man who was cut to the quick by love
kept on loving
the man who was
mercilessly tortured by thoughts
kept on thinking
the man who was crippled with concern
kept on caring

Hair of the dog
hair of the dog that turned
hair of the dog

The man whose eyes
were sore from obscenities
kept on looking
the man whose heart bled,
killed by compassion
kept on feeling
the man whose legs
buckled under exertion
kept on running
the man whose ears burned
with the sound of his own name
kept on listening

Hair of the dog
hair of the dog that turned
hair of the dog



THE PASSION OF LOVERS

She had nut painted arms
that were hers to keep
and in her fear
she sought cracked pleasures
the pasion of lovers
is for death said she
licked her lips
and turned to feather

And as I watched from underneath
I came aware of all that she keep
the little foxes so safe and sound
they were not dead
they'd gone to ground

The passion of lovers
is for death said she
the passion of lovers is for death

She breaks her heart
just a little too much
and her jokes attract
the lucky bad type
as she dips and wails
and slips her banshee smile
she gets the better
of the bigger to the letter

The passion of lovers
is for death said she
the passion of lovers is for death


OF LILLIES AND REMAINS

In the marbled reception hall,
I received a three band gold ring,
from Mark, a token of esteem,
running through ghost closet locker rooms,
to hide from Peter, who has fallen
to the old cold stone floor,
wheezing and emitting a seemingly
endless flow of ectoplasmic white goo
from ears and mouth
a wind rushes through hall,
whistles as it breezes through the narrow
slits in the green locker doors,
I hide in one of these, No. 13
barely concealed but hopeful
blackout
blackout!

I will climb this high wall
in remembrance of Clancy
to regain or re-earn my life
as I died just a flicker of an eyelid ago,
the wall has many holes
and many foot pieces to fasten to
the wall is dangerous, and this is my penance
my penance and my task

I did it once and they wondered
yet I need to go, once more around
up breathtakingly
across rigidly
down easily - and foolishly
I endeavoured again
to climb the wall in vain
and capture back my chain
of lillies and remains...



DANCING

Dancing on hot tiles
dancing on tender-hooks
dancing down church aisles
dancing on holy books
dancing on crocodiles
dancing on hallowed ground
dancing Nyinsky style
dancing with the lost and found

Dancing on rock'n'roll's grave
dancing on burning coals
dancing on 'Jesus saves'
dancing with old scratch soul
dancing on flick knives
dancing a stiletto groove
dancing our nine lives away
dancing in the Louvre

Dancing in catacombs
dancing in tuxedo dtag
dancing in dark rooms
dancing on all your flags
dancing in the Vatican
dancing on the papal gown
dancing on the taxman
dancing on the crown

We're dancing
to the dark side of this tune



HOLLOW HILLS

Ancient earth work, fort and barrow
discreetly hide their secret abodes
the most fearful hide deep inside
and venture not there upon yuletide

For invasion of their hollow hills
that music hold, and Oberon fill
is surely recommended not
for fear of death, in fear of rot

hollow hills, hollow hilis

Baleful sounds and wild voices ignored
ill luck luck, disaster, the one reward
violated sanctity of supermen's hills
so sad, love lies there still
so sad - so sad
hollow hills, hollow hills
witches too, and goblin too
and speckled sills
lament, repent, oh mortal you
so sad, so sad fade!...


KICK IN THE EYE

And he spoke of pastures green
I was never told why
each journey lasts an age
and my throat feels dry
it must be the lesson
hidden deep inside
it must be the lesson
so roll the tide

So I began the crossing
my throat burned dry
searching for satori
the kick in the eye
I am the end of reproduction
given no direction
every care is taken
in my rejection

Kick in the eye

Every care is taken
with my rejection
and my abduction
to my addiction
every care is taken
with my protection
and my abduction
from my addiction

Kick in the eye




IN FEAR OF FEAR

You fear the lesson
and fear to walk
and fear to pass on
you fear to talk

The teacher was feared
your parents too
then you became
the fear of you
Look to yourself
climb over the wall
and see behind
that you're not so small
then you won't blame fear
when competing's too much
as you fall on your back
as you fail to touch

And I say to you
when your fear is strong
when you fear your life
then your fear is wrong
set free your past
so shredding the skin
then you won't fear
the fear of sin

Fear




MUSCLE IN PLASTIC

Be like a dog
lay flat on my back
pull my feet off the ground
let my head hit the sack

I'm muscle in plastic
Nyjinski's bad move
just a white show piece
l've got nothing to lose

I preach for the praise
can't laugh so I gaze
like a bad offset
l'm just counting the days

l'm a muscle in plastic...

Sonar blips on my arms
my head's increased
just a hotel inmate
l'm the lover deceased
l'm the latent impression of dancer's leg
I like faking persuasion
and laying my bed

l'm a muscle in plastic...




THE MAN WITH X-RAY EYES

Shoes that no man would want to wear
wipe away the night's last cold stare
red fist curled round the house
wash away boy shelly's shoes
(wash)

Chocolate power is so crisp
the atomic open house is really here
and we have gone so desperate
your power knows no bounds
and heavier with time
are our shoes
that no man would want to wear
new tread wipes a wet road so dry
- it stings

Into the borrowed course
under the dreadful birds
under the singing soil
and all those guilty clouds

I have seen too much
wipe away my eyes
too much


MASK

The man of shadows thinks in clay
dreamed trapped thoughts
of suffocation day
he's seen in iron environments
with plastic sweat
out of chiselled slits for eyes

From the growth
underneath the closed mouth
you'll catch it you listen
rack trapped cubist vowels
from a dummy head expression
from a dummy head expression

The transformation is invested
the mysterious and the shameful
while the thing I am
becomes something else
part character part sensation

The shadow is cast
etc...



THIRD UNCLE

(Brian Eno)

There are tins
there was pork
there are legs
there are sharks
there was John
there are cliffs
there was mother
there's a poker
there was you
then there was you

There are scenes
there are blues
there are boots
there are shoes
there are Turks
there are fools
they're in lockers
they're in schools
they're in you
then there was you

Burn my fingers
burn my toes
burn my uncle
burn his books
burn his shoes
cook the leather
put it on me
does it fit me
or you
it looks tight on you



SILENT HEDGES

Following the silent hedges
needing some other kind of madness
looking into purple eyes
sadness at the corners
works of art with a minimum of steel

Pure sensation
the beautiful down grade
going to hell again

Self confidence leaks
from a thousand wounds
faults to civilisation
burning the private paradise of dreams
minus hands of the electric clock

Pure sensation
the beautiful down grade
going to hell again
going to hell again
again

IN THE NIGHT

In the night, in the chair
he sits there, he sits tight
no more cans, no more crime
see the place, see the time
you ever know

He walks light, don't know how
maybe now, in the night
Oh, I know, yes, I know
there's no chat
he's for show
you ever know

Sees the place and tries to get the time
he's slowly slipping into the slime
can't inject into his veins
blood and guff ooze out and stain
cares not that he really bleeds
death not hell is what he needs
sees the place, checks the time
some other place, some other time
you never know

Slipping up and down his writhing side
his eyes begin to ponder pride
subjective pics of misled youth
before him lies the dreadful truth
'undignified' 'insignified'
his wrist on to the razor slides
you never know




SWING THE HEARTACHE

Out of her mouth it came as no surprise
lipstick stained on whipcream lies
I feel that if I had been uglier
it would have been easier

There it sat, blinked and spat
in a black feather hat
and said 'The Rat'
(I now possess quasi success)

But she was to be a better singer
swing the heartache
just for her sake

SPIRIT

Tonight I could be with you
or waiting in the wings
lift your heart with soaring song
cut down the puppet strings

I wear a coat of drums
and dance upon your eyes
turn the tables upside down
change the lows to highs

I fill you up with butterflies
crown the heads of kings
be glad of first night nerves
for fear gives courage wings

If I am on the sidelines
chances are you'll miss
wait alone and spotlit
for doctor theatre's kiss

The stage becomes a ship in flames
I tie you to the mast
throw your body overboard
the spotiight doesn't last
I could be with you
or waiting in the wings
lift your heart with soaring song
cut down the puppet strings

I may tap you on the shoulder
and whisper 'go' in red
strip your feet of lead my friend

Call the curtain
raise the roof
spirits on tonight

We love our audience


THE THREE SHADOWS (part II)

Oh classic gentlemen
say your prayers
to the wind of prostitution
to your faces, and rex complexes
riddle my breast
full of the oppressed puss

O gentlemen, with your fish
that you surround, all around
and you man, will always point
your fishes, at me

But I will always exist
because I always exist
damn good too

The rat race begins
the fat face stings
I hold the fresh pink baby
with a smile
I slice off those rosy cheeks
because I feel so thirsty

and Oedipus rex complexes...




THE THREE SHADOWS (part III)

O gentlemen
swallow your prayers
because the wind makes a mockery of men
your soul become a fish
you swim in idle waters
and drink other fishes piss
your soul feeds on fish
on piss, puss and men
who in turn,
become as you have become
a fish
no, not even that,
but a symbol of fish
hooked by the baby flesh of maggots
a ripple of life in tin
this tin could become your world too
so choose between this and water
choose between tin and piss
do you still feel thirsty now
are you thirsty now
are you thirsty now
do you still feel
thirsty
thirsty now...



ALL WE EVER WANTED WAS EVERYTHING

All we ever wanted was everything
all we ever got was cold
get up, eat jelly
sandwich bars, and barbed wire
squash every week into a day

The sound of drums is calling
the sound of the drum has called
flash of youth shoot out of darkness...
factorytown

Oh to be the cream





EXQUISITE CORPSE

Life is but a dream
I make the air fall apart
around me
now as the petals are no more
a corroding, shrinking stalk remains
bereft of his blooms
and the ultimate cruelty of loves pinions
beset his appearance
no king could replenish his state
now browning, sinking, dying
a thousand deaths

Terry sat up
and hugged the army surplus bag
around his skinny waist
it was cold
and the person beside him has failed badly
legs apart his eyes lit up
the sky's gone out - the sky, the sky -
the sky's gone out

Zzzzzzzzzz!

The sky's gone out



SHE'S IN PARTIES

Learning lines in the rain
special effect by loonatik & drinks
the graveyard scene
the golden years

She's in parties
it's in the can

Freeze frame screen kiss
hot heads under silent wigs
fall guy's tumble on the cutting room floor
look-a-likes fall on the cutting room door

She's in parties...

Learning lines in the rain
special effects by loonatik & drinks
freeze frame screen kiss,
hot heads, lightsand powder,
it's patently obvious

She's in parties...

Hot lines under a rain of drums
cigarette props in action
dialogue dub, now here's the rub
she's acting her reaction

She's in parties...




ANTONIN ARTAUD

The young man held a gun to the head of God
stick this holy cow
put the audience in action
let the slaughtered take a bow

The old man's words, white hot knives
slicing through worm butter
the butter is the heart
the rancid pealing soul

Scratch pictures on asylum walls
broken nails and match sticks
hypodermic hypodermic hypodermic
red fix

One man's poison is another man's meat
one man's agony another man's treat
Artaud lived with his neck placed
properly in the noose
eyes black with pain
limbs in vamps, contorted
the theatre and its double
the void and the aborted

Those Indians wank on his bones



KING VOLCANO

Overshadowed by her sister
pretty girl would screem

King Volcano gave me numbers
King Volcano is clean

Lonely people burn like candles
only we are clean




WHO KILLED MR. MOONLIGHT

Consider green lakes
and the idiocy of clocks
someone shot nostalgia in the back
someone shot our innocence

A broken arrow in a bloody pool
the wound in the face
of Midnight proposals
someone shot nostalgia in the back
someone shot our innocence

In the shadow of his smile

All our dreams have melted down
we are hiding in the bushes
from dead men
doing Douglas Fairbanks stunts

All our stories burnt
our films lost in the rushes
we can't paint any pictures
as the moon had all our brushes

Extracting wasps from stings in flight
who killed Mr. Moonlight?

Who killed Mr. Moonlight?
in the shadow of his smile



SLICE OF LIFE

Her gaze hit the side of mine
so I opened it out
to destroy what you thought was difference
So I lied to you once again
so I painted over you once again
so I die before you once again
what's the difference

Come clearly where the tlavour's
seen here in black and white
you've got two seconds baby boy
in burning light white light
what's the difference

Clear up what you are
burn out these eyes
rip up this place and scream
I am your slice of life

Shivering under lamposts
shivering under glass
your standing on charisma again
God knows it cannot last
what's the difference

Ice inside your body
blood inside your soul
yet still twelve faces stand around
hugging your skinny bones
what's the difference

So clear up...

And the car opened him up to so much more
and the money is brighter with a wider smile
and the problem expands inside your head

I am your slice of life



HONEYMOON CROON

Honeymoon croon tonight
sew my socks tonight
I say whose on the race tonight
lurking lipstick tickle tickle
Marylin on

Send her by air mail par avion
certificate ecstasy in my head
hire out Sybill Vane for my bed

Honeymoon croon tonight...

She insists on tying down
after the soldier sator
all alone in the cathedral bar
she preys in dockland
she asks to see her hidden side
she, the colour of his money

Honeymoon croon tonight...

Marylin's fading fast better get straight
the catch from the side walk is in a state
the sound of footstep - mummy's here
l'll be her good boy, l'll never fear
better fix her drink tonight
bed times come
must be out of this urge to use my gun




KINGDOM'S COMING

Madness in the winds got something to say
it ripped you apart
it will always be that way

Kingdom's coming, causes chaos
will cut to pieces
the film you saw today
it's your big bad secret
your crown of thorns
you want got nothing, nothing, nothing at all

Just look back, back again
you wanted ail, but it's on the run
the sky will open soon, could be today
your kingdom's coming, coming this way

Can't take it easy now
can't turn back
forget your bastard ego
get it off your back

It's too late now
can't turn back
your kingdom came today



BURNING FROM THE INSIDE

Running without aim
throu the razor weeds
that only reach my knees
and when l'm lying in the grey deep
I don't know how to walk the boards

I open my eyes and look at the floor
and now I don't see you anymore

There is no choice, we make the point
to counter act, a threatening hand
close my hold
let's be near the atmosphere



HOPE

Your mornings will be brighter
break the line
tear up rules
make the most of a million times no



THE SANITY ASSASSIN

Sinister echoes clutching at straws
letterboxes screaming
you try to pin him to the wall
you end up on the ceiling
locked in a dome
the shadows flicker by
he's the mad cap pusher
delerium the drug he's dealing

He drops a capsule in your drink
and spikes your dreams with madness

He's the sniper in the hiils
hiding in the holes in your head
he's the poison in your poison
the razor in your bed
hanging on a picture
eye lid needle and thread
you empty yourself once again
he's always one step ahead
was it whispers in your ear
nothing that you said?
he's walking in your sleep now
he keeps your fat paranoia well fed

He drops a capsule...

The sanity assassin
stays up allnight stalking
the sanity assassin
picks of victims like flys
the sanity assassin
let his fingers do the walking
the sanity assassin
the crack shot between your eyes
he's got you in his sights

He drops a capsule...




DARK ENTRIES

Caressing bent up to the jug again
with sheaths and pills
invading all those stills
in a hovel of a bed
I will scream in vain
oh please mill lane
leave me with some pain
went walking through this city's neon light
in fear of disguising my warping seathing
pressure lines and graceless heirs
intangible of price
trying so hard to find what? What was right
I came upon your room it stuck into my head
we leapt into the bed degrading even lice
you took delight in taking down
all my shielded pride
until exposed became my darker side
puckering up and down some avenue of sin
too cheap to ride they're worth a try
if only for the old times cold times
don't go waving your pretentious love
he's soliciting on his tan brown brogues
girating through some lonesome devils row
pinpointing well meaning
upper class prey
of walking money checks possessing holes
he often sleekly offers his services
exploitation of his finer years
work with loosely woven fabrics
of lonely offices clerks
any lay suffices
his dollar green eye




BELA LUGOSI'S DEAD

White on white translucent black capes
back on the back
Bela Lugosi's dead
the bats have left the bell tower
the victims have been bled
red velvet lines the black box
Bela Lugosi's dead
undead undead undead
the virginal brides file past his tomb
strewn with time's dead flowers
bereft in deathly bloom
alone in a darkened room
the Count Bela Lugosi's dead
undead undead undead




TERROR COUPLE KILL COLONEL

His eyes were heavy
he carried a card
one couple questioned
the other discharged
terror couple kill colonel
in his West Germany house

shots from three feet
dragged himself to the phone
terror couple kill colonel
and has he lay there
playin' games with his pain
the felt his choice of job
was such a mistake
he could have been a doctor
in a soft easy chair
instead he choose three stars
a territorial affair
terror couple kill colonel

in his West Germany house
