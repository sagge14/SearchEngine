Although avant-garde musicians discovered the joy of classical Indian music
long before, it wasn't until the mid/late 1960's that classical Indian music
found its way into the mainstream of Western music, when the Beatles' George
Harrison popularized the sitar.  Since then, the influence of classical 
Indian music has been felt in rock and roll, jazz, and beyond.

This is a guide to jazz music which contains elements of classical Indian 
music. This guide is a spin-off from a discussion on the Usenet group
rec.music.bluenote.  The people who contribute to that group's discussion 
are responsible for much of the information contained herein, and i am forever
in their debt for their help & continued assistance in keeping this list 
up-to-date.

As jazz has no definitive boundaries, there is certainly some overlap with
rock and roll; i've also included `New Age' listings as some would classify it
as jazz.  I have *not* included Western Classical, rock, or other non-jazz 
collaborations between Indian and Western artists (such as Ravi Shankar's 
collaborations with Yehudi Menuhin, Zubin Mehta, Andre Previn, George Harrison, 
Philip Glass, etc.).  The list is pretty straight-forward, in alphabetical 
order according to last name; references which can be consulted separately 
are CAPITALIZED.  I didn't include every album by each artist mentioned, but 
rather those albums which contain elements of both classical Indian music 
*and* jazz.

I wish i could individually thank each and every person who contributed to the
Classical Indian/Jazz fusion thread (and thus this work), but there's too many 
to name...

Of course, any errors are my own, and will be corrected in the next edition
of this list...*please* feel free to contribute additions, corrections, 
comments, whatever!

instruments (the drone of the tamboura is often present).  Check out the title

OREGON
------
Along with SHAKTI, this was perhaps one of the finest groups for Indian-jazz
fusion (as well as other worldly) music, thanks to sitar/tabla player COLLIN
WALCOTT, who unfortunately was killed at an early age in 1984 in an automobile
accident in Germany.  At that point, TRILOK GURTU took his place, and joined
PAUL MCCANDLESS, RALPH TOWNER, and GLEN MOORE. all of whom (with Walcott) got
their start performing with THE PAUL WINTER CONSORT.

BARRE PHILLIPS
--------------
Phillips, a bass player, generates mostly spacey stuff, some of which sounds
Indian due to the presence of TRILOK GURTU on Indian percussion.

Album: Three Day Moon (1979, ECM 1123)
Personnel: Barre Phillips (bass), Terje Rypdal (guitar, synth, organ), Trilok
  Gurtu (percussion), Dieter Feichtner (synth).

HUSSAIN.  He appears on numerous classical Indian and Indian-jazz fusion
albums, including those of MICKEY HART, VASANT RAI, and RAVI SHANKAR.

Album: Rich a la Rakha
Personnel: Alla Rakha (tabla), Buddy Rich (drums), Ravi Shankar (sitar).


VASANT RAI
----------
Rai, a sarod player (he also plays guitar, flute and piano!), in addition to
Classical Indian performances with ALLA RAKHA, also produced the following

Album: Spring Flowers (Vanguard VSD-79379)

RAINBOW -- see JOHN HANDY

"Kundalini" and DAVID LIEBMAN's "Sweet Hands."

Album: Passing Dreams (1976, Adamo ADS9501)


PHARAOH SANDERS
---------------
Sanders' sax playing is very meditative, with lots of ethnic percussion, and
borders on Indian-jazz fusion.  The epitome of this sound is perhaps the song
"Harvest Time" on "Pharaoh", which is very raga-like.  In addition to his solo
works, he appears with other artists, notably ALICE COLTRANE.

Album: Pharaoh (India Navigation IN-1027)

Album: Best of (Impulse 9229)


CARLOS SANTANA -- see ALICE COLTRANE, JOHN MCLAUGHLIN
--------------


PHIL SCARFF

Scarff, a jazz saxophonist and composer, studied North Indian classical music.

bansuri.  He performs not only with his own group, Natraj, but also with WARREN
SENDERS' Antigravity.

Jerry Leake on tabla.

Album: Antigravity (1992, Cadence; Accurate Records AC-4307 [CD])


SHAKTI
------
The unequaled *epitome* (IMHO) of Classical Indian/jazz fusion.  Guitarist
JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, violinist L. SHANKAR, and percussionists ZAKIR HUSSAIN,
and T.H. Vinayakram came together for an altogether too brief three albums
to produce music in a class of its own.

  Hussain (percussion), T.H. Vinayakram (percussion)

Album: Shakti with John McLaughlin (1975, Columbia PC 34162 {US}, CBS 81388

BUD SHANK -- see RAVI SHANKAR, L. SUBRAMANIAM
---------


L. SHANKAR
----------
Shankar, a South Indian violinist, is *not* directly related to North Indian
sitar player Ravi Shankar, although he is the brother of violinist L.
SUBRAMANIAM. [The L. in their names is short for Lakshminarayana; to make
matters confusing, there is another L. (Lakshmi) Shankar (a female vocalist)
who appears on at least one jazz-Indian fusion album!]  In addition to being a
member of SHAKTI, Shankar performed separately with its members ZAKIR HUSSAIN
and JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, as well as with various other jazz artists, including
DARK, JAN GARBAREK, TRILOK GURTU, JON HASSELL, and PERCY JONES.  Shankar is an
amazingly
versatile performer, having played rock and roll with his own group "The
Epidemics" (which includes his wife Caroline), and with, among others, Frank
Zappa, PETER GABRIEL, George Harrison, The Talking Heads). Shankar also plays
pure Classical Indian music, as well as Western symphonic music.

Album: Song for Everyone (1985, ECM 1286)
Personnel: L. Shankar (violin), Jan Garbarek (sax), Trilok Gurtu (percussion),
  Zakir Hussain (percussion)

Album: Vision (1984, ECM 1261)
Personnel: L. Shankar (violin), Palle Mikkelborg (trumpet), Jan Garbarek (sax)


RAVI SHANKAR
------------
This well-known North Indian sitar player (arguably one of the finest
musicians in the world) has dabbled in innumerous genres, including
Indian-jazz fusion, especially with PAUL HORN.  He's probably played with
every known Indian musician, including ALLA RAKHA.  Included among those on
his Indian-jazz fusion albums are BUD SHANK and TOM SCOTT.

Album: ? (1961, World Pacific ST 21416)
Personnel: Ravi Shankar (sitar), Kanai Dutta (tabla), Nadu Mullick,
  Harihar Rao (tamboura), Bud Shank (flute), Dennis Budimir (guitar), Gary
  Peacock (bass), Louis Hayes(drums).

  [Johann Haidenbauer notes: "Unfortunately I don't know the title of this
   record.  This is the earliest Jazz/Indian-music fusion album I know of."]

Personnel: Ravi Shankar (sitar), Alla Rakha (tabla), Bud Shank, Tom Scott
  (flute), Artie Kane (piano), Laurindo Almeida, Bob Bain (guitar), Ray

from "Mountain Stream".

Album: Mountain Stream (Sonnet SLP-2636 {out of print}; Sonnet SNTF818)


RALPH TOWNER
------------
Another musician who gets around a fair bit when it comes to Indian-jazz
fusion.  Towner went from the PAUL WINTER CONSORT to OREGON, and since that
time performed with a number of artists mentioned in this guide, including
LARRY CORYELL, JAN GARBAREK, EGBERTO GISMONTI, and Oregon members TRILOK

This Brazilian percussionist, perhaps best known as a member of the Pat
Metheny group, appears on a variety of albums.  He was a seminal member of
CODONA, and performed with, among others, ANCIENT FUTURE and PERRY ROBINSON.

[Albums listed under CODONA]


COLLIN WALCOTT
--------------
Originally a member of the PAUL WINTER CONSORT, Walcott went on to form OREGON
with PAUL MCCANDLESS, RALPH TOWNER and GLEN MOORE.  While in Oregon he
concurrently teamed up with DON CHERRY and NANA VASCONCELOS to form the group
CODONA, and also released solo albums and collaborations with JOHN
ABERCROMBIE, DAVE HOLLAND, JACK DEJOHNETTE, and others.  He played tabla on
many albums, including MILES DAVIS' "On the Corner", COSMOLOGY's "Ditto", and

  (violin), Jim Hotep (tabla), Midnite (tamboura), Michael Chechik (organ),


PAUL WINTER CONSORT
-------------------
One of the earlier efforts at combining Western music with music from
throughout the world, including lots of Indian influence thanks especially
to the presence of COLLIN WALCOTT.  Consort members Walcott, GLEN MOORE, PAUL
MCCANDLESS and RALPH TOWNER went on to form OREGON.  The Paul Winter Consort
has been (and continues to be) highly prolific though it has seen many
personnel changes over the years.  (I'm not sure if all the albums listed
below contain Indian-jazz fusion stuff.)

WORLD MUSIC MEETING
-------------------
This is one album i'd like to know more about...i got a tape from a friend
with this album on it, but minimal information.  In addition, i can barely
read my friend's scrawl, so i'm sure i've got a lot of the names wrong.  Quite
a variety of world instruments, including, of course, Indian.  This ensemble
included TRILOK GURTU and CHARLIE MARIANO, among many other lesser known
names.
