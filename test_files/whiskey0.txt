Well, I used to love me whiskey,
It made me nice and frisky,
But then they pushed me in a fire
Sing if you think I'm a liar.

Oh, the Celts they went out raiding, 
They didn't much like the sailing
But every sheep within their land
Was hidden well from their war band. 

Said the captain to his men now:
"We'll show those Vikings just how
They think that they have got it made
Don't worry, lads, for we'll get laid!"

Said the widow, "Won't you leave be!
Don't take me daughter from me!
For then I know what I will do,
I'll kill myself and then haunt you."

Said the raider to the widow:
"What are ye daft and dumb now!
Your daughter ye can keep right here,
Your sheep we'll take, no, never fear."

When the Celts they'd land to pillage
They'd go straight to the village,
"We'll let you be if you give us  
All your sheep and make no fuss."

All the wise men in the small towns
Said, "Who the hell are these clowns?
If sheep is all they care to take,
Then give them up, for pity's sake!"

Now the Celts they filled their boat up
Before the army showed up,
And from offshore they laughed and cried
Happy with their wooly prizes.

At last the Celts they sailed away
And then the chieftain he did say:
"Well, three sheep each is not so bad!
At last I can become a dad!"
