== i. == About this FAQ ======================================================

This FAQ is intended to help those trying to get a GUS working along side
a Sound Blaster. It is maintained by Daniel Rogers. (iidan@cs.utexas.edu)
It is currently a pre-release, since I need to polish things up a bit, add
some more sections, and receive some feedback. The general concepts here
can probably be used to get other sound card combinations working together.
Let me know of any successes or failures.
*** NOTE ***
Hopefully there will soon be a  much improved FAQ, covering Windows,
Linux and OS/2 installation and use with the Sound Blaster and GUS. I am
releasing this interim FAQ to fix a few small errors or omissions in the
previous FAQ.

== 1. == Introduction ========================================================

1a.
[Q] What is a Sound Blaster?

[A] A Sound Blaster is a sound card for IBM PC and compatibles, designed
    to provide higher quality sound for games and applications. Creative Labs
    manufactures the actual Sound Blaster, but there are many different cards
    which claim to be Sound Blaster compatible. This may or may not be 100%
    compatibility, and it may only be compatible with certain Sound Blasters.
    Currently, Creative Labs makes and markets the Sound Blaster, Sound
    Blaster Pro, Sound Blaster 16, Sound Blaster 16 Multi CD, Sound
    Blaster 16 SCSI-2, and Sound Blaster AWE 32. Each card is different, the
    listed cards going from least advanced to most advanced. Each is
    theoretically sound compatible with the original Sound Blaster, and the
    Sound Blaster 16 and 32 models are sometimes Sound Blaster Pro
    compatible. More information on Sound Blaster cards can be found in the
    PC Soundcard FAQ. For purposes of this FAQ, whenever "Sound Blaster" is
    used, it is meant to refer to the Sound Blaster card you are using,
    whether it be a Pro, 16, or Basic unless it is explicitly specified.


1b.
[Q] What is a Gravis UltraSound?

[A] The Gravis UltraSound (from here on out known as GUS) is a sound card
    for IBM PC and compatibles that is manufactured by Advanced Gravis.
    It features wave table synthesis, digitized recording and playback, and
    can emulate other sound cards including the Sound Blaster. Currently
    there are two UltraSounds, the original GUS and the GUS MAX, which was
    recently released. Both share the same main chip and are virtually the
    same when it comes to sound playback. The GUS also has RAM on board the
    card, anywhere from 256k to one megabyte to load and store sound
    samples. More information can be found in the GUS FAQ.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1c.
[Q] Can I use a Sound Blaster and GUS together?

[A] In almost every case, yes. How is addressed later in this document.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1d.
[Q] Why do I want to use a Sound Blaster and a GUS together?

[A] This is a common question, especially since the GUS claims to be Sound
    Blaster compatible. The GUS is Sound Blaster compatible only with the use
    of TSR's, in other words it is software simulation, not hardware. Since
    this is the case, many times a game or application will not work or will
    not work fully. Adding a Sound Blaster card to the GUS card allows
    a user to take advantage of both sound cards, for optimum sound.
    In most cases where both sound cards are used, the GUS is used for the
    music, and the Sound Blaster is used for the digitized sounds.

== 2. == Setting up the Sound Blaster and GUS together =======================

2a.
[Q] Which card should I install first?

[A] In general it is better to install the Sound Blaster first. It is less
    flexible in its settings. However it is not hard to install a Sound
    Blaster after installing a GUS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2b.
[Q] What settings should be used for the Sound Blaster [Pro, 16]?

[A] The Sound Blaster card should be configured as close to the defaults as
    possible. This is because certain software tends to expect the card to
    be at a certain address, IRQ, and DMA. The following table lists
    suggested settings for the Sound Blaster family of cards.

                |Sound Blaster | Sound Blaster Pro | Sound Blaster 16
    ---------------------------+-------------------+-----------------
    I/O Address |    220h      |       220h        |      220h
    IRQ         |     7        |        5          |       5
    8-bit DMA   |     1        |        1          |       1
    16-bit DMA  |     -        |        -          |       5

    The Sound Blaster 16 cards (Basic, SCSI-2 and Multi-CD) are the most
    configurable. Remember what settings are used on these cards for the
    CD or SCSI controllers if applicable. Do not set up conflicting IRQ or
    DMA numbers.
2c.
[Q] What hardware settings should be used for the GUS?

[A] Most of the GUS settings are set with software. The I/O Address is
    the one hardware setting on the GUS that you must worry about.
    (Q. How about the GUS MAX?) The address used must be different than the
    address used on the Sound Blaster card. Possible addresses are:
    210h, 220h, 230h, 240h, 250h, and 260h.

    Address 210h is generally a safe address. Address 220h is usually
    reserved for the Sound Blaster. Since the GUS uses not only the
    addresses listed above, but addresses 100h up from those, use of
    addresses like 230h are discouraged, since 330h is used by other cards,
    including the Sound Blaster and some SCSI cards. The same goes for
    address 240h. Addresses 210h, 250h, and 260h are usually fine, but check
    other cards for possible conflicts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2d.
[Q] What software settings should be used for the GUS?

[A] The GUS should be set up to not conflict with other cards and devices in
    the computer. This can be tricky. Suggested settings are:

    GUS IRQ: 5, 7, 12, or 15 (*)
    Recording DMA: 5, 6, 7 (+)
    Playback DMA:  5, 6, 7 (+)
    Sound Blaster/MIDI IRQ: 12, or 15 (*)
    Sound Blaster DMA: 1
    
    + The recording DMA and playback DMA can be the same unless you have a
      special reason for them to be different. If you are using a Sound
      Blaster 16 or better, make sure that its 16-bit DMA is different than
      the GUS's DMAs.

    * The GUS IRQ and Sound Blaster/MIDI IRQ must be different. (Q. Is
      this always the case?)

    The Sound Blaster DMA should be 1, since it won't be used.

    I tend to shy away from IRQ 11, since SCSI cards often use this IRQ,
    but if you know there are no conflicts, it is fine to use it. Also,
    IRQ 13 (Q. I think it is 13?) can be used if you do not have a math
    co-processor. (i.e. a 486SX without a math co-processor)

    If you are having trouble with the GUS when running programs that require
    a DOS extender such as dos4gw, try a GUS IRQ setting less than or equal
    to IRQ 7. Remember to watch for conflicts with other cards and devices.
    If you are having trouble with DOOM or DOOM][ in native GUS mode, try
    an  IRQ of 7 or less. IRQ 5 or 7 should be free in DOS if you are
    just going to play games. That way the Sound Blaster could be at either
    5 or 7, and the GUS at the other.

    Use the Diagnostics in the GUS setup program to determine if there are
    any hardware conflicts.

2e.
[Q] Why isn't the GUS setup program working?

[A] In order to select the settings mentioned in 2d, the Advanced setup must
    be selected. This will allow you to choose the settings you need and
    check for hardware conflicts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2f.
[Q] Why does the GUS setup say the Sound Blaster test failed?

[A] Since there is already a real Sound Blaster card installed and since
    the GUS settings are not set to work with the GUS Sound Blaster emulation
    software used with the GUS, the Sound Blaster test will fail. This is
    normal. Ignore this and select install anyway.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2g.
[Q] Why is the SET BLASTER environment variable in my autoexec wrong?

[A] The GUS setup program assumes (incorrectly) that you will be using the
    Sound Blaster emulation software that comes with the GUS. It sets the
    SET BLASTER variable to match what you told it in the setup program.
    You need to replace this SET BLASTER variable with the correct one for
    your Sound Blaster card.
2h.
[Q] What should my autoexec.bat file look like?

[A] Here is a sample autoexec.bat file, used with a GUS and a Sound
    Blaster 16. This is just the part pertaining to the two sound cards:

    SET ULTRASND=210,7,7,12,15
    SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 H5 P330 T6
    SET ULTRADIR=D:\ULTRASND
    SET GUSMOD=D:\ULTRASND\MOD
    D:\ULTRASND\ULTRINIT.EXE -ej
    SET SOUND=D:\SB16
    D:\SB16\SB16SET /M:240 /VOC:220 /CD:220 /MIDI:220 /LINE:220 /TREBLE:0
       /OPGAIN:2,2
    D:\SB16\SBCONFIG.EXE /S

    Here are the parameters for the first two lines:

    SET ULTRASND=<GUS IO Address>,<record DMA>,<playback DMA>,<GUS IRQ>,
                 <MIDI IRQ>
    SET BLASTER=<SB IO Address>,<SB IRQ>,<8-bit DMA>,<16-bit DMA>,
                <MIDI Port IO Address>,<Card Type>

    The SB16SET has the option /OPGAIN:2,2 because the line out on my
    Sound Blaster 16 is normally lower than the line out on my GUS.

    The options for ULTRINIT.EXE are:
      -o    Leave output enabled after it resets the card
      -m    Leave microphone input enabled
      -l    Leave line level input enabled
      -d    Disable UltraSound joystick port
      -e    Enable UltraSound joystick port

    The Sound Blaster Pro would have a SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 T4 and the
    appropriate initilizations. Likewise for the regular Sound Blaster

    Be sure and check to make sure the directories are correct, and that the
    correct SET BLASTER variable is set, since the GUS setup tends to
    overwrite this with an incorrect value.

2i.
[Q] How do I mix the two sound outputs?

[A] There are several options. The easiest is to just run two separate output
    cords to the speakers. This works if there is more than one sound input
    on the speakers. Altec Lansing, Acoustic Research, and other computer
    speakers have multiple inputs. Most receivers also have multiple inputs
    if you wish to run the sound through your stereo system.

    If there is only one speaker input, it is possible to primitively mix the
    two outputs using a Y adapter such as those found at Radio Shack.
    (part number 274-313 or 42-2463) However this should probably be a
    temporary solution, as it is not an ideal solution.

    The stereo line out of the GUS can also be routed to the stereo line
    input of the Sound Blaster. This should allow the output from the
    Sound Blaster to carry the mixed sound signal. You may have to fool with
    the mixer (Sound Blaster Pro and 16) to get optimal results. Make
    sure the cable you use has stereo 1/8" plugs on both ends, especially if
    routing into a Sound Blaster Pro or better.

    The reverse is also true. The Sound Blaster line out can be routed to the
    GUS line in. Be sure to enable the -l option (Q. and the -o?) with
    ultrinit.exe and the -l option on megaem when it is used. This will turn
    on the line input on the GUS for mixing. If there is excessive noise
    coming from the GUS/Sound Blaster when not using the sound card, it is
    possible that the Sound Blaster is picking up electrical noise from
    the computer. In that case, run ultrinit without the -l option to
    turn off the line in. Re-run ultrinit with the -l option when the
    Sound Blaster sound is needed again.

    It has been suggested that if you have a Sound Blaster Pro or better and
    an old GUS before revision 3.7, then the GUS output should be routed to
    the Sound Blaster as above. If you have a newer GUS, the Sound Blaster
    should be routed into the GUS. The best thing to do is try it both ways
    and decide which one gives the best sound.

== 3. == Using the Sound Blaster and GUS together ============================

3a.
[Q] What card do I select in my software setup?

[A] If there is native GUS support, choose the native GUS support. Games like
    DOOM and Raptor have native GUS support. It generally sounds better than
    the Sound Blaster support, and in some cases can take a load off of the
    CPU.

    If there is no native GUS support but there is separate support in the
    program for a music card and a digital effects card, then try to use the
    GUS for the music and the Sound Blaster for the digital sound effects.
    If there is a General Midi or Roland Sound Canvas option, choose this.
    If there is no GM or Sound Canvas option, but there is Roland MT-32,
    LAPC1 or just Roland, choose this option. Choose the Sound Blaster for
    the digital effects and give the program the correct settings. Before
    running the application, be sure to run megaem -sboff and then run
    emuset for the Sound Canvas or GM support or emuset -mt for the LAPC1,
    Roland, or MT-32 support. Consult the Gravis documentation for more
    options on these programs.

    If there is just Sound Blaster or Adlib support, it is best to use only
    the Sound Blaster. But that is what you kept it around for, right?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3b.
[Q] How do I run SBOS?

[A] Don't. Use the real Sound Blaster instead.

== 4. == Trouble shooting ====================================================

4a.
[P] My Sound Blaster works, but my GUS doesn't!

[S] There are a number of things to check. It is almost surely a set up
    problem. Double check the GUS settings (see section 2). Check that the
    output to the speakers is plugged in correctly. Check your software
    setup. (see section 3) Try just the GUS by itself and see if it
    works.  Some motherboards don't work when the GUS uses a 16 bit DMA
    channel. Try DMA channel 3 in this case.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4b.
[P] My GUS works, but my Sound Blaster doesn't!

[S] Be sure that the SET BLASTER environment variable in the autoexec.bat
    file is correct. (see 2g) Make sure the output gets to the speakers.
    (see 2i) Check the volume on the back of the card. The Sound Blaster
    cards that have a line out option tend to be at a lower level than the
    GUS line out. Try unplugging the GUS output and just running the
    Sound Blaster. Check for hardware conflicts with other cards as well as
    the GUS. (see section 2) Check the software setup. (see section 3)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4c.
[P] Neither the GUS nor the Sound Blaster works!

[S] Re-check all the settings from section 2. Check the outputs from the
    cards. Try one card at a time to see if they work. Check for conflicts
    with each other. Make sure the IRQs, DMAs, and I/O Addresses are
    different. Check for conflicts with other cards. Check to make sure the
    autoexec.bat file is correct. (see 2h) Check to see if the software is
    set correctly. (see section 3)

4d.
[Q] What other cards could be causing conflicts?

[A] Any card you have in your computer. SCSI cards often use IRQs 10 or 11,
    the parallel port or printer port uses IRQ 7. Network cards can use a
    range of IRQs and most cards have an I/O address that can conflict. Get
    out the manuals and start checking. A program such as Norton Utilities
    can be helpful for diagnosing conflicts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4e.
[P] MEGAEM won't work!

[S] Be sure you use the -sboff option (i.e. megaem -sboff) to turn off the
    Sound Blaster emulation in the megaem software. It is not needed since
    the real Sound Blaster is present and can be used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4f.
[P] The joystick doesn't work right!

[S] Disable the joystick port on the Sound Blaster card and use the joystick
    port on the GUS. The -e option on ultrinit.exe turns on joystick support
    for the GUS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4g.
[P] You still haven't answered my question!

[S] Check 5a below. If you are still having problems, post a polite message
    to an appropriate Usenet newsgroup.
