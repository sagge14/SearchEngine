BEATLES NOVELTY RECORDS               November 22, 1992       compiled by Moko
=======================

This list includes:

	songs about the Beatles
	songs that mention the Beatles
	songs that quote Beatles songs
	parody songs to the tune of Beatles songs
	covers of Beatles songs that are so bad as to be funny
	covers of Beatles songs by unexpected "artists" (e.g. William Shatner)
	songs that are deliberately and outrageously Beatlesque (e.g. Rutles)
	parodies of the Beatles' image, such as their appearance or album covers

(All the above categories also apply to the ex-Fabs in their solo careers,
as well as George Martin, Yoko, Julian, Sean, Zak, Pete Best, Macca's sheep-
dog, etc.)

This list does not include:

	songs performed by the Beatles or the ex-Fabs
	covers of Beatles songs which do not have some novelty value (These are
	well documented in Scott Galuska's "COVERS" list, available from saki
	at dmac@math.ucla.edu)

The cover of _The Abbey Road E.P._ by The Red Hot Chili Peppers is a parody of
the _Abbey Road_ cover. It's a photo of the Peppers walking across the famous
crosswalk, naked except for socks on their cocks (a fashion statement often on
display in their stage shows).
1988 EMI-Manhattan CD # CDP-7-90869-23

"All Good People" by Yes: the background singers are chanting
"All we are saying, is give peace a chance".
[someone else says this song is "Your Move".]

-----
"Alison" by Elvis Costello:

     I'm not gonna get too sentimental,
     Like those other sticky valentines.
     'Cause I don't know if you were lovin' somebody;
     I only know it isn't mine.

This may be a reference to:

     Would you believe in a love at first sight?
     Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time.  
     What do you see when you turn out the light?
     I can't tell you but I know it's mine.

This sounds like a stretch, at first, but each couplet seems to refer to its
counterpart.
-----

"All I Want for Christmas is a Beatle" by Dora Bryan was released during the
Fabs-in-suits era. It might have been to the tune of "All I Want for Christmas
is My Two Front Teeth".

"All I Want Is Everything" by Jellyfish:
"I think I'd like to play guitar and be a Beatle, and be so swell."

"All the Young Dudes" by Mott the Hoople:
"Well, my brother's back at home with his Beatles and his Stones."
[winner in the song-most-often-contributed category] 

In 1976 a two-record set appeared with music from the soundtrack of a truly
mutant documentary called "All This and World War II", which consisted entirely
of Beatles songs don in (sometimes VERY odd) versions by a bevy of British
singers of varying renown, along with some non-Brit pop stars of the 70's.
20th Century Records LP # 2T-522

"All You Wanna Do Is Dance" by Billy Joel:
"Why don't the Beatles get back together?"

"American Pie" contains many lines thought to refer to the Beatles.
[I am seeking permission to quote from or point to the definitive Pie article.
In the meantime, I will forward it to anyone who asks.]

_Chet Atkins Picks on the Beatles_ Chet plays Beatles songs on solo guitar,
with occaisional harmonica. Liner note by George Harrison.
RCA Victor LSP 3531

_Bach, Bayless, Beatles_ [1985 Intersound, Inc./Pro Arte CD # CDD 413]

[A third album is available. Title???]
All by John Bayless. Various Beatles tunes are performed on piano as if
composed by Bach. One of the albums (_B, B, B,_?) is a compilation of songs
from the other two. Available in most record stores in the classical section.

"Ball of Confusion" by The Temptations:
"The Beatles' new record's a gas!"

_Baroque Beatles_ Obviously, Beatles music as played in the Baroque style. I
found it interesting as an undergrad to play it for unsuspecting visitors...
who would invariably start humming along, amazed they knew this "classical"
piece... and then watch their faces as they suddenly realized WHY they
recognized it.

_The Baroque Beatles Book_ [same as above album?] by the Baroque Ensemble of the
Merseyside Kammermusikgesellschaft; Joshua Rifkin, conductor.
It features several pre-1966 Beatles songs done up in a Baroque style, and has a
recitative (that's a Baroque rap, basically) of some of John Lennon's writings.

_Beetle Beat_ by The Buggs (awaiting a review copy :-)

1990 Fontana LP # 842 293-1  cassette # 842 293-4  CD # 842 293-2
or (remixed) on 45 # 875 282-7

"Beatles Breakfast" is not a song, but a parody of the Fabs having breakfast
and dropping song lines (e.g. "You want eggs, while I AM
the egg-man.")

_BEATLESONGS: A Collection of Beatles Novelties Volume 1_

-----

"The Beetle" - available on BEATLESONGS

"Between John & Yoko" by Easy is on _Magic Seed_ (1990) and _Mute International
Sampler_

"Bring the Noise" by Public Enemy: Yoko is mentioned in name only (as a
rhyme with Sonny Bono, no less!).

Peter Sellers did "Can't Buy Me Love" as a duet with himself (one male, one
female). Available on a 1991 EMI compilation (title???).

---
The Capitol Steps, a political novelty group, have done several songs to the
tune of Beatles songs:

"I Got High a Couple of Times With My Friends" about Doug Ginsberg's nomination
to the Supreme Court

"Fools On the Hill" about Congress (They've done two like this.)

"Maxwell's Silver Stammer" about military jargon

"When I'm Sixty-Two" about Social Security

For more information on The Capitol Steps, call 800-733-STEP.
---

"Car Phone" by Roger McGuinn from has a plot about a guy who dies as a hitman
explodes some dynamite in the back of his car by calling him on the car phone.
In the back, after this happens, is a little sighing chorus of "he blew his
mind out in a caaaa---aar".

"C'era un Ragazzo che Come me Amava I Beatles e I Rolling Stones",
written by Lusini & Migliacci, by Joan Baez off "The Contemporary Ballad
Book". [in the running for "most obscure reference"]

As part of his Weird Al Yonkovic's food medley, he has "Chicken Pot Pie" instead
of "Live and Let Die" (I have heard that this is true. I have not heard it
myself.) [confirmation, anyone?]

_The Chipmunks Sing The Beatles_ (aka _The Chipmunks Sing The Beatles Hits_)
features some of the early songs.
EMI-Manhattan Records CD # CDP-7-48370-2
1982 Liberty Records LP # LN-10177

The Chipmunks' _Alvin All-star Chipmunk Band_ is vaguely like SPLHCB.

"Close But No Cigar"  by Thomas Dolby samples some of the incidental sounds
from Sgt Pepper's.

Crazy Calls - many funny asswering machine messages. One of them is in
Beatles style.

"A Day In the Life of Green Acres" by Barnes and Barnes and Abraxas combines
the tune (sort of) of "A Day In the Life" with the lyrics of "Green Acres".

"A Day In the Life - 91" by Whimsical Will is a story constructed out of the
titles of 91 Beatles songs. It's spoken, not sung.

Utopia has an album entitled _Deface the Music_ in which all the songs are
Beatlesque. The album cover is a sort of parody of the _With the Beatles_ cover.
[Does this have anything to do with an ELO album called _Face the Music_?]
1980 Rhino/Bearsville LP # RNLP 70873

"Don't Get Me Wrong" by Bonzo Dog Band from _Let's Make Up & Be Friendly_ is
a shameless Beatles parody, with someone who does a more-than-credible Lennon
imitation. (1972?)

"Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio?" by The Ramones:
"Do you remember Jerry Lee, John Lennon, T. Rex and [can't hear this] too?"
Available on _Ramonesmania_ 1988 Sire Records CD # 9 25709-2

"Eddie Are You Kidding" by Flo & Eddie from _Illegal, Immoral & Fattening_
has a segment that lampoons a lot of pop stars, including a bit of "My Sweet
Lord" where George's voice breaks down.

Doodles Weaver did "Eleanor Rigby" as if he was drunk.
Available on _Dr. Demento's Delights_ 1975 Warner Bros. Records LP # BS 2855

"Empty Garden" by Elton John is about the death of John Lennon.

"Everybody's Making It Big But Me" by Doctor Hook mentions Elvis, Dylan,
Mick Jagger, The Beatles and just about everyone else.

"Evil Woman" by ELO:
"There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in..."

"Garden Party" by Rick Nelson:
"Yoko brought her walrus, there was magic in the air."

"Girl at the Window" by the Idle Race (Jeff Lynne):

	"John and Paul and Ringo and George
	were playing lovely tunes
	from the window of her room
	by the light of the moon..."

"Give Booze a Chance" by the Bonzo Dog Band

"Give Peas a Chance" (artist unknown)

-----
"God II" by U2 from _Rattle and Hum_  
a few sample lines:

     I don't believe the devil

     Don't believe in Goldman,
     His type like a curse
     Instant Karma's gonna get him, if I don't get him first
     I don't believe that rock-and-roll
     Can really change the world
     As it spins in revolutions, spirals and turns

     I...I believe in love...

[The song is dedicated to Lennon.]
-----

_Golden Throats: The Great Celebrity Sing-Off!_ has a truly awful rendition
of "Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds" by William Shatner (!), originally from
his _Transformed Man_ LP. Mae West does "Twist and Shout" on this album (cover
of a cover).
Rhino CD # R2 70187

_Golden Throats 2: More Celebrity Rock Oddities!_ has Bing Crosby's version
of "Hey Jude", and "Give Peace a Chance" by Mitch Miller & The Gang.
Mitch: "Hassle the man! Hassle the Congress!"

"The Great Late Johnny Ace" or "The Late Great Johnny Ace" by Paul Simon or
Simon and Garfukel is about John Lennon, or is about another real or fictional
person but mentions John ("A stranger came up and asked me if I'd heard John
Lennon had died.")...or something. He sang part of it in _The Concert in
Central Park_ (1981), but it isn't on the album because the song was
interrupted by a loony getting on the stage and yelling at Mr. Simon. It is on
the video of the concert. It was later (1983) included on an album (title?). Is
that all clear, now? :-) The only thing I will swear to is that it is not
currently available on 8-track tape.

_A Hard Day's Night_
"Starring The Manchesters"
another "Let's rip off some unsuspecting kids before this Beatlemania thing
dies" album
includes:     A Hard Day's Night
              Please Please Me
              I Want To Hold Your Hand
              She Loves You
Diplomat Records LP # D2335 (no copyright date)

Peter Sellers did "A Hard Day's Night" as Richard the Third and "Help!" as
a vicar and choir. Available on a 1991 EMI compilation (title???).

-----
In the sixties there was a band in Israel that would take Beatles song and put
Hebrew lyrics onto them - usually completely changing the point, but in very
Beatles style.  For example:

"From Me to You"

If there's anything that you want
Lama at lo yotzeit iti?
Why won't you go out with me?

If there's anything I can do
Mah at ratza achrel hahu
Why do you run after him?

...etc...

The band was called Hagashash Ha'Chiver, I think
-----

"Here We Go" by C&C Music Factory mentions the Beatles and the Jackson 5.

"Hey Jude" by Bing Crosby - see Golden Throats above

"I Am the Walrus" by Men Without Hats

-----
"I Dig Rock-And-Roll Music" by Peter, Paul and Mary:

	And when the Beatles tell you
	Because they would love to tell you
	They mean exactly what they say.

The second line has also been quoted as
	"There's something they'd love to sell you"
    and "They have a word - LOVE - to sell you".     ???
-----

"If You Want It, I Can Get It For You Wholesale" by Lazlo and Gary satirizes

"John Lennon" by The Outfield from _Diamond Days_ makes many references
to Lennon songs.

"Keep It Warm" from _Moving Targets_ by Flo & Eddie:

     And George is suing Paul suing Ringo
     And immigration wants John and Yoko
     All they need is love
     To keep it warm
-----

"The Late Great Johnny Ace" - see confusion at "The Great Late..." above.

-----
The La's
Not a parody group, and they don't mention the Fabs in any of their songs. In
fact, they don't belong on this list at all, but they *are* four boys from
Liverpool who play great music, and yes, they have been called Beatlesque.
That's my only excuse for this item. I just think they're a great band and
I think most Beatlefans will like their music.
_The La's_    1990    Go!/London/Polygram Records CD # 828 202-2
-----

"Leprosy - I'm not half the man I used to be." to the tune of "Yesterday".
No doubt there is more to this, but fortunately I haven't heard it.

"Let There Be More Light" from _A Saucerful Of Secrets_ by Pink Floyd:
They clearly sing "...like Lucy In The Skyyyyy!".

-----
"Life In A Northern Town" from _Dream Academy_ by Dream Academy (1983? 84?
								 86? 87?):
     He said "In winter 1963
     It felt like the world would freeze
     With John F. Kennedy
     And The Beatles."

     (ghostly echo of crazed teenage screaming...)
-----

"Liverpool Bound" by Vito and the Salutations:

	"She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah,
	she loves you, no, no, no!
	We're packing our bags,
	and leaving for England,
	'cause those Beatles got it all over here.
	We're packing our bags,
	and leaving for England,
	We'll make it big over there..."

"London Calling" by The Clash: "...phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust..."

"Louisiana Hookers With Herpes" by Frank Zappa, to the tune of "Lucy In the
Sky With Diamonds" (Have heard this is true; have never heard it.)

"Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds" by William Shatner. see Golden Throats above.

-----
The Swinging Erudides did "Paul McCartney Massacre" which had several
Beatles satires:

	"Silly Paul McCartney" to the tune of "Silly Love Songs"
	"Stupid People Living in the Past" (Sgt. Pepper)
	"Yesterday Pts 1 and 2"
	"Robert Plant Serenade" (Beatles connection???)

Beatles songs.

Goodbyes". [artist?]

-----
"Negligee" to the tune of "Yesterday"

Negligee,
I look stupid in this negligee
'Cause my butt sticks out this funny way --
Oh, why'd I buy this negligee?

Suddenly,
I am twice the girl I used to be;
Flab is hanging out all over me --
This negligee's a travesty.

Why it doesn't fit I don't know, I couldn't say;
I did something wrong when I bought this negligee.

Negligee,
I would like to take it back today,
But I threw the darn sales slip away --
I'll have to keep this negligee.
Hmm mm mm mm oo oo oooooo.

"Never Been to Spain" by Three Dog Night:
"Well I've never been to England / But I kinda like the Beatles"

"1977" by the Clash:
 ...something like "No Elvis, no Beatles, no Rolling Stones - it's 1977"

"No More Beatlemania!!!!!" by 1/2 Japanese

"Obese Man" is to the tune of "Nowhere Man"

"101 Dalmatians" (by Scarlet Party?) contains several lines borrowed
from various Beatles and Lennon songs. For example:

citation from "I Am The Walrus".

"Polkas on 45" by Weird Al Yankovic, contains a fragment of "Hey, Jude."

"Pop Hates The Beatles" to the tune of "Pop Goes the Weasel" by Alan
Sherman. It's on his Greates Hits album and _Beatlesongs_. He is a
father who complains about the Beatles being too loud and having hair
that is too long. (Also complains that ticket prices are 50 dollars
each. Inflation makes that complaint seem trivial.)

Roger Waters mentions Yoko Ono on "The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking".

as rags.
Fanfare Records / Pro Arte CD # CDD 373 (widely available in the jazz section)

"The four kings of EMI are sitting stately on the floor."

"Rest In Peace" by Extreme:
"Someone said give peace a chance, and that was all that was said"

"Ringo Deer" by Lorne Greene was a Christmas song, about the lead reindeer
having a big nose 'a la Ringo Starr. [Not to be confused with "Ringo" (also
by Lorne Greene, I think) which is about a gunfighter or a cowboy or something.]

"Rocket" by Def Leppard mentions Sgt. Pepper and the band".

"R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A." by John (Cougar?) Mellencamp (sp?) mentions
the Beatles.

**************************************************************************
The Rutles
Hands down the most prefab group ever. More like the Beatles than the
Beatles were. Both the movie and the album are the best parodies of our
boys ever done. The movie is a documentary of the Rutles' career. The
album contains songs from various stages in the band's development. Songs
written by Neil Innes. Movie produced by George Harrison, who also has a cameo.

album: _The Rutles_ 1978 Rhino CD # R2 75760

Really. No kidding. Would I lie?

"Sally Sails the Sky" by Ian Whitcomb: "Then Elvis Saint Pepper, the rock 'n'

asked Timothy Leary, but he couldn't help me either."


***** Sgt. Pepper wing ******************************************************

The soundtrack album of "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" is a treasure
trove of godawful performances of Beatles songs. (The movie is even worse.)
1978 RSO Records LP # RS-2-4100

Abbey Road 78, "Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."  Songs from the movie
but worse; fortunately only half as long.

styles.
Rhino Records CD # R2 70371

"Summer Rain" by Johnny Rivers:
"...And the jukebox kept on playin' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"

spoof of SPLHCB , complete with cutouts, and Frank Zappa with his back to
the camera to indicate his recent death.
Verve V6-5045X

first side has an interesting melding of "Give Peace a Chance" and "We Will
Rock You" and a cover of "I've Just Seen A Face", with Danny Bonaduce (of
Partridge Family fame) singing lead. The second side is a long cover of Yoko
Ono's "Don't Worry Kyoko".
1988? Giant Records?

UNIX Man      (tune of "Nowhere Man")

He's a real UNIX Man
Sitting in his UNIX LAN
Making all his UNIX .plans
for nobody

Knows the blocksize from 'du'
Cares not where /dev/null goes to
Isn't he a bit like you
And me?

UNIX Man, don't worry
It's the tube that's blurry
UNIX Man
The new kernel boots, just like you had planned

He's as wise as he can be
Programs in lex, yacc and C
UNIX Man, can you help me
At all?

UNIX Man, please listen
My printout is missin'
UNIX Man
The wo-o-o-orld is your 'at' command

"We Love You Beatles" is a takeoff on "... Birdie". Available on _BEATLESONGS_

_We're Only in it for the Money_ (see at SPLHCB above)

"Where Have All the Good Times Gone?" by the Kinks has something like:

     Yesterday  love
     was such an easy game for you to play
     but now let's face it
     things are so much easier today
     let it be like yesterday...

This is horribly paraphrased, but it came out in 1966 or so, and makes
references to other current songs (including their own).
-----

"The World is Mine" by Wally Winger and the Amazing Skippy (as Gorbachev and
Reagan) is a satire of "The Girl is Mine", written by Michael Jackson and
recorded with Paul.

-----
Write in C   (tune of "Let It Be")

When I find myself in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom:
"Write in C."

As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers:
"Write in C."

Write in C, write in C,
Wtite in C, oh, write in C.
LOGO's dead and buried,
Write in C.

I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics!
Write in C.

If you've just spent nearly 30 hours
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.

Write in C, write in C,
Write in C, yeah, write in C.
Only wimps use basic.
Write in C.

Write in C, write in C,
Write in C, oh, write in C.
Pascal won't quite cut it.
Write in C.

Write in C, write in C,
Write in C, yeah, write in C.
Don't even mention COBOL.
Write in C.

Mark Russell did a song about the Congressional pay raise to the tune of
"Yesterday". I have this nagging feeling he also used the tune of
"Eleanor Rigby" sometime.

Harry Nilsson's version of "You Can't Do That" includes background bits (and
some not-so-background) of various other Beatles songs, and ends with "Lovely
Beatles Forever" sung to the tune of Strawberry Fields Forever?  It's on a mid-
to-late 60s album called Pandemonium Shadow Show (also on another compilation
LP [_Aerial Pandemonium_?] which combined _Pandemonium Shadow Show_ and _Aerial
Ballet_) and  it is apparently the album which triggered the Lennon/Nilsson
mutual admiration society.

"Young Americans" by David Bowie:
Background singers: "I read the news today, Oh boy"

"You're in a Bad Way" by The Happenings
"...water's coming down like pins and needles
stereo is blasting through your pad - probably the Beatles..."

In "Your Move" by Yes, at the end when they're singing didit didit didit didit
didit etc - Chris Squire and Steve Howe sing "All we are saying. . . is give
peace a chance!" [Someone else says this song is "All Good People".]
