   Dear ModemNews Readers,

        America has a serious problem that must be dealt with as soon
   as possible.  It seems that it is perfectly OK for the government
   to subsidize the tobacco industry while at the same time spending
   money to tell us that we are being ruined by addictive drugs.  We
   all know that nicotine is one of the MOST addictive drugs.

        We are not told that the cost of alcohol abuse is more than
   TWICE that of illegal drug use.  We are made to believe that the
   majority of crimes are committed by casual drug users, while the
   full truth lies hidden behind the administrations bombast and
   rhetoric.  Whose drug war are we fighting?

        Face it.  There is BIG money in illegal drugs, mostly
  'because' they are illegal.  Most drug related crimes are
  perpetrated by dealers and not by the users.  Drugs of all sorts
  have been around for thousands of years, so why is it now that we
  are faced with the alleged problems?

        Like it or not people will always find some artificial method
  of altering their own personal reality.  Some will use 'legal' drugs
  like valium, librium and alcohol.  Some will find others.

        ModemNews Magazine is interested in knowing how you feel about
  this subject.  We will look at this one step at a time.  For
  starters we would like to look at the legalization of Marajuana.  
  We'd like your opinions on whether marajuana should be legalized, if 
  so under what conditions, and what should be done about educating 
  the public.

        Please send your comments on this subject to ModemNews OnLine 
  at (516) 679-0674 and tell us what you think.  The results will be 
  published in a future issue of our magazine.  Your participation 
  will be appreciated.
