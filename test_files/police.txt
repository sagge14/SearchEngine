			       I'll Be Copying You
		  To the tune of "Every Breath You Take"-The Police
			 By The Slipped Disk-a.k.a The Messenger


Every game you make, Every one you create,
From all the time you stake, It's you code I will break, I'll be copying you.

Every single day, I'll be hacking away,
It's your game I will play, I copied it by the way, I'll be copying you.

Oh can't you see, you lose royalties,
There's no mercy, I't won't matter to me.

Everything you do, I'll be screwing you,
You'll be out of luck, I'll find some other shmuck, I'll be copying you.

What you do I'll be easily able to trace,
Everything you do will become a big goddamn waste,
I'll look around and find someone else to face,
When it comes to software it is just one big goddamn race,
I'll copy them and hack it, hack it, Now!

Oh can't you see, you lose royalties,
There's no mercy, It won't matter to me.

Everything you do, I'll be screwing you.
You'll be out of luck, I'll find some other shmuck, I'll be copying you.
You'll be out of luck, I'll find some other shmuck, I'll be copying you.

I'll be hacking you......I'll be hacking you......I'll be hacking you....
