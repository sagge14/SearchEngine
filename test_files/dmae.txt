                             DMAE
                             ----

DMAE, or dimethylaminoethanol, is normally present in small amounts in our
brains. DMAE is known for its remarkable brain-enhancement effects. It is a
naturally occurring nutrient found in seafood such as anchovies and sardines.
Perhaps this explains why fish has often been called brain food.

DMAE elevates mood, improves memory and learning, increases intelligence,
extends life span of laboratory animals (Hochschild, 1978), and increases
physical energy. It is used by many people for its mild, safe stimulant
effect and yet DMAE also makes it easier for most people to get to sleep.
Many people report less fatigue in the day and sounder sleep at night as well
More<n,Y,=>           as needing less sleep when taking DMAE.

The stimulant effect of DMAE is significantly different from the stimulation
produced by coffee, amphetamines, or other stimulant drugs. DMAE does not
have a drug-like quick up and quick come-down. People who take DMAE have
reported that after three to four weeks, they feel a mild stimulation
continually, without side effects. Also, when DMAE is discontinued, no
depression or let-down occurs.

Riker laboratories developed a prescription drug called Deaner (sometimes
called Deanol). This substance is the p-acetamidobenzoate salt of DMAE and
has very similar effects. Riker marketed their DMAE-like product for learning
problems, under-achievement, shortened attention span, hyperactivity, reading
and speech difficulties, impaired motor coordination, and behavioral problems
in children.

DMAE works by accellerating the brain's synthesis of the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine, which in turn plays a key role in maximizing mental ability as
well as in preventing loss of memory in aging adults.

Precautions: Overdosage can produce insomnia, dull headaches, or tenseness in
muscles especially those of the jaws, neck and legs. These side effects
More<n,Y,=>           disappear if the dosage is lowered slightly. No serious adverse effects have
ever been reported with DMAE. Patients with certain types of epilepsy should
be closely monitored by a physician. DMAE should not be used by people who
are manic depressive because it can deepen the depressive phase.

Dosage: DMAE is used initially at low dosages with a gradual build up to
500mg or 1000mg per day. In some cases lower dosages can result in a good
response. DMAE can take as long as three weeks to take effect.

Sources: DMAE is considered a nutritional supplement and can be found at
health food or drug stores. It comes in bulk powder form, capsules, or
liquid. Liquid DMAE may spoil if left open or if stored at high temperatures.
Keep it tightly sealed in the refrigerator. For sources of DMAE see appendix
A. Other names include: Acumen, Atrol, Bimanol, Cervoxan, Deaner, Diforene,
Dimethaen, dimethylaminoethanol, Elevan, Pabenol, Paxanol, Risatarun,
Tonibral, and Varesal.
