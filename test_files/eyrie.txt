Yes, you've probably all heard it, but what the heck...Mary has a great
explanation on tape of how Leslie wrote the song (Mary, could I transcribe
it and post it?), although I haven't heard the story yet about how it
became the underground anthem for one of the democratic revolutions in
Eastern Europe (Hungary?  Mary, do _you_ know the story?)

            HOPE EYRIE

  (Well) worlds grow old, and stars grow cold
  And fate we never can doubt
  Time's cold wind whistling down the pass
  Reminds us that all flesh is grass
  And history's lamps go out

    (Refrain)

    But the Eagle has landed!  Tell your children when!
    Time won't drive us down to dust again!

  Seasons turn while the far stars burn
  And people and planets age
  Life's torch passes to younger lands
  Time brushes dust of hope from his hands
  And turns another page

    (Refrain)

  We know well what life can tell
  If you would not perish then grow
  But today our fragile flesh and steel
  Have laid our hands on a vaster wheel
  With all of the stars to know
 \
    (Refrain)

  We who feel the weight of the wheel
  When winter comes over our world
  Can hope for tomorrow and raise our eyes
  To a silvery moon in an open sky
  Where a single flag's unfurled

    (Refrain)

  From all who tried out of history's tide
  A salute to the team that won
  The old Earth smiles at her children's reach
  The wave that carried us up the beach
  To reach for a distant sun

    (Refrain x2)
