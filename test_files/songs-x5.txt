                        THE JIMMY SWAGGERT SONG                      
                        (Tune: "Dick Darby The Cobbler")
                        (Recorded: "Celtic Pride: In Strange Form")

        Oh, me name is Jimmy Swaggert, I'm a preacher,
        I used to save souls on TV
        But they caught me carousing with floozies
        And they've taken my program from me!

        (CHORUS): With me ing twing of an ing thing of an eye do
                  W'i me ing twing of an ing thing of an eye day,
                  W'i me roo-boo-boo roo-boo-boo randy,
                  And me bankroll gets bigger each day!

        Well, when I was a lad, ma would scold me
        Sayin' "James, keep your hands off your crotch!"
        Well to do so was "dirty" she told me,
        But she never said I couldn't watch!

        Well, they labeled Jim Bakker a pervert,
        And they called me a lecher, it's true;
        Even though I never did nothin'
        I just asked for a room with a view....

        Well, my sorrows they soon will be over,
        And I'll soon be a rich man again,
        For I've just sold my story to Playboy,
        And the movie rights to MGM!

                      OUR BABY DIED LAST NIGHT

                      Our Baby died last night
                      It lived for 48 hours
                      And it cost a hundred dollars
                      It was a lousy baby, anyway.

                      His head it turned to mush;
                      It skwushed between my fingers;
                      The memory still lingers;
                      It was a lousy baby, anyway.

                      Although he tried to bite us
                      He died for just to spite us
                      Of spinal meningitus
                      It was a lousy baby, anyway...

                      (spoken:) So we ate it.....cold.

                        FIGHT FOR LIBERATION
                        (Tune: "Tramp, Tramp, Tramp")

        In a dungeon cell I sit, covered o'er with Royal Shit,
        While our money turns the Kingdoms' filthy mill
        And the Directors as they pass, jam Corpora up our ass
        Well. I guess we've had our Goddam fuckin' fill!

        CHORUS: Fight, fight, fight for Liberation!
                Break, break, break the Social Scheme!
                Oh, we'll drag the bastards down,
                And we'll grind them in the ground,
                And replace 'em with a Working Class Regime!

        Oh we'll send a firing squad after Royalty's Tin God
        And the Heralds they will be the next in line
        Then we'll pump some LSD into Their Senilities
        And we'll make 'em fuck the peasants overtime!

        Oh, we'll take a fuckin' rope, and we'll hang the fuckin' Pope
        And we'll burn the Sistine Chapel to the ground!
        Then we'll turn our tommy-guns on the screaming ravished nuns
        And the People's Voice will be the only sound!

        So if you hate the Working Class, but you'd like to save your ass
        Then you better give your money to the poor!
        Or we'll sell your mother's twat to a sailor on your yacht
        And we'll turn your favourite daughter to a hoor!

                         VATICAN CASKETS
                         (Tune: "Rock Of Ages")

                Vatican caskets are just fine
                Made of sandal-wood and pine
                When your loved ones have to go,
                Die with "cum Spiritu tuo!"
                When your loved one's pass away
                Have them pass the Vatican Way!
                Sistine Chapel, Saint Peter's, too
                Holy water just for you!

                Vatican caskets, unlike a rose,
                They will never decompose.
                For they stand the test of time;
                No need to kill the flies with lime!
                Get down on your knees and pray
                When your loved ones pass away!
                Vatican customers all sing:
                Death, O Death, where is thy sting?

                        AGAINST ALL FLAGS
                        (Tune: "Girl I Left Behind Me")

        Oh, the SCA is the kind of play
        That spodes all get their kicks on
        And Pennsic War is the kind of bore
        That the peoples can get sicks on!
        And I'd like to sod the Goddam BoD
        With a dildo made of brass on,
        And the (insert name) Flag is the kind of rag
        That a Mongol wipes his ass on!

        Oh the Chivalry are very "twee,"
        And the Laurels don't do nothin'.
        And the Pelican fags are all on the rag;
        In an uproar about somethin'.
        For the King and Queen are seldom seen,
        With their Goddam cute brass hats on,
        And the (insert name) Flag is the kind of a rag
        That a Mongol wipes his ass on!

        Oh the Great Dark Horde doesn't have a sword
        That's worth a wooden firkin
        And the Moritu don't know what to do
        But sit and jerk their gherkin!
        And the Tuchux upchuck woodchuck guts
        At the Royal's brass-ass hats on,
        And the Mongol flag is the kind of a rag
        That the Kingdom wipes it's ass on!

                        RAMBLIN' HUNCHBACK, or:
                        THE BALLAD OF RICHARD III
                        (Tune: "Rye Whiskey")

        I am a ramblin' hunchback, I ramble around
        I ramble thru your cities, I ramble thru your towns.
        I went into a tavern to get me some lunch
        Where all the macho stick-jocks made fun of my hunch

        Well I said sticks and stones may injure my bones,
        But names will never hurt me, so leave me alone!
        I was scratchin' my back, and when I looked up,
        A blonde, hare-lipped waitress poured coffee in my cup!

        It was love at first sight, as my brew I did sip,
        She patted my hump, as I caressed her lip!
        Lord, I left with that waitress, because, as you see,
        The womens all love my deformity!

        (Repeat first verse)

                            THE POPE

        There's a man who lives over the ocean
        And who has got a great notion
        That he is the World's Greatest Hope
        He's Giovanni Montini, the Pope

        CHORUS: Giovanni Batista Montini
                He lives in the Vatican-nini
                He's Italian; he doesn't use soap
                He's Giovanni Montini, the Pope!

        When Atheists try to distract him
        He doesn't let it upset him,
        He just makes the High Sign on his chest,
        Lets his Boss Man take care of the rest!

        No cherub could ever sub-pee-ni
        Giovanni Batista Montini
        For how can you possibly quibble
        With a man who is infalli-bibble?

        CHORUS: Giovanni Batista Montini
                He lives in the Vatican-nini
                And he don't even have to smoke dope
                'Cause he's Giovanni Montini
                You know who I mean-i
                The one with the beanie!
                Giovanni Montini, the Pope!

        Wake up, little floozie, wake up!
        Wake up, little floozie, wake up!
        The Tourney wasn't so hot
        And you got drunker than snot!
        And now, it's over, I've won the Crown,
        And BOY! are we in a spot!
        Wake up, little floozie!
        Wake up, little floozie!

        Well, I told the Duke I wouldn't rhino-hide
        Well, floozie, baby, it looks like that I lied!
        Wake up little floozie (etc.)

        What're we gonna tell the Countess?
        What're we gonna tell the BoD?
        What're we gonna tell the Duke when he goes
        Oh, My Ghod!
        Wake up little floozie (etc.)
        We gotta go reign!

             THE KINGDOM THAT SWALLOWED A LIE
                        -Ardjukk Afraid-of-His-Cats

     There once was a Kingdom that swallowed a LIE
     I don't know why they swallowed a LIE......
     Perhaps they'll die!

     There once was a Kingdom that swallowed a RULE
     "The King's Word is Law" (We learn it in school!)
     They swallowed the RULE to hold up the LIE
     I don't know why they swallowed the LIE
     Perhaps they'll die!

     There once was a Kingdom that swallowed some BULL
     "The knights run the Kingdom, they have all the pull!"
     They swallowed the BULL to back up the RULE
     "The King's Word is Law!" (We learn it in school..)
     They swallowed the RULE to hold up the LIE
     And I don't know why they swallowed the LIE
     Perhaps they'll die!

     There once was a Kingdom got screwed by the CROWN
     Bent over, and down, they got screwed by the CROWN
     They got screwed by the CROWN 'cause they swallowed the BULL
     (etc as above)
     I don't know why they swallowed the LIE......
     Perhaps they'll die!

     There once was a Kingdom that wrote to the BOARD
     They wrote to the BOARD in great disaccord
     They wrote to the BOARD they'd been screwed by the CROWN
     Bent over and down, they were screwed by the CROWN
     (etc as above)
     And I don't know why they swallowed the LIE......
     Perhaps they'll die!

     There once was a Kingdom that took up the SWORD
     'Cause they didn't get s*** when they wrote to the BOARD
     They took up the SWORD when they wrote to the BOARD
     They wrote to the BOARD in great disaccord
     (etc as above)
     I don't know why they swallowed the LIE......
     Perhaps they'll die!

     There once was a Kingdom that threw up the LIE
     Right in their eye, they threw up the LIE
     They threw up the LIE and they changed all the RULES
     Opened Crown Tourney to all but the fools,
     They opened Crown Tourney to sweep up the BULL
     And let in the People, a real Miracle!
     They swept up the BULL and laughed at the BOARD
     And every man-jack of 'em joined the Dark Horde!
     And so they lived happy, and wealthy and wise
     And if this is treason, then it's all a LIE
     Can YOU see why?

                  It'll make your flowers grow!

        Now, peerages are given for a reason
        And that reason is simply understood:
        For Chivalry, and Honesty, and Bravery
        And being very, very, very Good!

        Awards are given out to the deserving,
        And no one EVER bitches, out of spite!
        We forget the little slights and innuendos
        And we really DO believe that Right makes Might!

        "Nepotisim" is a word we've never heard of,
        "Politics" is just a friendly little game!
        We have counted every shot that we've been given,
        And Camelot is where we always aim!

        Oh the King is up there, sitting in the Throne Room,
        And the Pelicans are sitting on the grass,
        The Knights are getting drunk and falling down (a lot),
        And the Laurels are all sitting on their...laurels! 

        The BoD is doing something I'm not sure of,        
        The Registry has lost your membership,
        The Marshallate can't find it's head with both hands and a road-map,
        And the Heralds are all full of chicken-ship!

        Trelon, Trelon, this isn't very much fun
        At Estrella, outnumbered two-to-one!
        I'm here to tell you, Buster,
        We felt a lot like Custer!
        When we got beat
        We were cold meat!
        Out at Estrella V!

        Trelon, Trelon, looks like they did it again
        No fun, re-run, as our army they over-ran!
        They beat us and they banged us,
        They crucified and hanged us,
        It's getting old
        Them beating us cold
        Out at Estrella VI!

        I watch you walk upon the streets of London
        Your mini-skirt stretched tight, and looking sweet
        I watch you walk, and walk into a lampost
        I didn't see, upon the London street.
                So turn your back, and wiggle softly from me!
                With mini-skirt, (perhaps, no underwear!)
                Your legs are great! But, by the Gods above me!
                I watch your wondrous London derriere!

        The Paris girls are wonders full of beauty,
        And California grows the Long-stemmed L.A. rose,
        Berlin nights are full of life, and lovely,
        But London girls don't wear no panty-hose!
                So turn your back, and wiggle softly from me!
                And let me watch, and dream a dream so rare:
                In my hotel, you naked there above me
                Sit on my face with your London derriere!

                     THE SHEIK OF HOUSE LOCKSLEY
                     (Tune: "Sheik of Araby")

        I'm the sheik of House Locks-lee (with no pants on!)
        Your bod belongs to me! (with no pants on!)
        At night when you're asleep, (with no pants on!)
        Into your tent I'll creep! (with no pants on!)
        And wondrous things you'll see! (with no pants on!)
        I'm the sheik of House Locks-lee! (with no pants on!)

        nb: the section in (parentheses) is whispered........
