THE SEMI-CANONICAL THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS
"STUMP THE BAND" LIST V 1.0
---------------------------------------

This list is an attempt to document the many "Stump the Band" songs that
were played over the course of the "Don't Tread On the Cut-Up Snake" 
World Tour 1992.

For those who are unaware of what "Stump The band" was, it was a feature
of the They Might Be Giants Band (That is, TMBG with Tony Maimone, Jon
Feinberg, and Kurt Hoffman behind them) where they would ask members of the
audience to shout out song titles, and the band would choose a song and 
attempt to play it. They insisted on never playing the same song twice,
and as a result the unique TMBG sound was adhered to timeless classics.

Eventually, of course, the same songs kept being shouted, and eventually
TMBG decided to switch to "Spin the Dial", where they would choose a song
off the local radio stations. While this was interesting, I personally
found the idea of the band performing songs whose titles were being shouted
by the audience a much more alluring concept.

Here then, is the list, as complete as it could be at the moment.
Note that TMBG did not play "Stump the Band" at all their shows, and
I'm still trying to track down people who went to all the shows.
