REAPPORTIONMENT REARS UP AGAIN by Jane Rein'l
(Dem Bones) Antiphonal Chorus
 
That map, that map,
Gotta draw again
That map, that map,
Gotta draw again
That map, that map,
Gotta draw again
Now hear the word of the law
 
Black folks connected to--black zones
Chicanos connected to--Spanish zones
Hopis disconnected from--Navazones
Now hear the word of the law.
 
(repeat chorus)
 
Democrats connected to--Dem zones
Republicans connected to--Gop zones
Incumbents connected to--own zones
That ain't the word of the law
 
That map, that map,
Gotta draw again
That map, that map,
Gotta draw again
That map, that map,
Gotta draw again
Now hear the word of the law.
 
THE STREETS OF NORTH SCOTTSDALE by Beth Luey
(to the tune of The Streets of Laredo)
 
As I wandered out
on the streets of North Scottsdale
As I wandered on in North Scottsdale one day,
I spied an old yuppie
all dressed in blue pinstripes,
But his blue pinstripes had started to fray.
 
"I see by your outfit that you are a yuppie.
I see by your suit and your power tie too.
Come sit down beside me
and tell your sad story.
I've seen burnt-out cases
but none quite like you."
 
"I was a PR man who pulled in big money
From Lincoln and Keating
and all of that crew.
But all of a sudden, around 1990,
All the bondholders decided to sue.
 
"Let bankruptcy lawyers come carry my coffin.
Let six MBA's come and follow me down.
Let all the accountants
come balance my ledgers.
And drive the stretch hearse
through the best parts of town.
 
"So bang the drum slowly,
and play the pipes lowly.
Please scatter my ashes uptown at high noon.
And take my suspenders
to use for guitar strings.
So you and your buddies
can sing this sad tune."
 
     Singalong: (repeat chorus)
