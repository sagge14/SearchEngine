It is available in all larger urban areas, but is not common.  You need to
be pretty well connected to get it.

Boiling point is very low.  You can smoke it by placing about 10 mg
on aluminum foil, and holding a lighter under the foil to warm it.
It vaporizes into a white cloud, and you suck the smoke through a tube
or something to help catch all the smoke.  It comes in a white powder,
and looks similar to good white heroin.  I think it would be hard
to aldulterate, unless you adulterated it with something that also
vaporized very easily.  Ie, if you aldulterated it with sugar, the
Aminorex would evaporate first, then the sugar would just burn, and
you would be aware that you got burned.

Not many side effects.  If you do a large amount for several days
you can get diareaha.  Nothing too severe though.  A bit of dry mouth
is common after smoking it.  I also started to get a sore throat
after smoking for a solid week.

I developed somewhat of a tolerance after 4-5 days of constant use.
A few days off, and the tolerance seemed to disappear.  My brain
was so clear when I used this, that I came up with answers to 
problems that had been bugging me for months.  This stuff makes
your brain work at 100% efficiency and doubles processor speed.
It makes you feel (and probably actually does) like your IQ jumped
quite a bit.  It is kind of a bummer not doing it at the moment
because my brain feels so slow now in comparison to before.  A gram
would last you anywhere from a week to a month depending on how much
you do.  I estimate one hit at 10 mg, so a gram would give you 100
hits.  2 hits makes you feel alert.  5 hits makes you euphoric and
will let you stay up all night long without feeling the leat bit
tired.  Sleep will never even occur to you.  Do 2 more hits in
the morning before work, and you will never miss the sleep from
the night before.  As a matter of fact, you will feel better than
if you had skipped the drug and slept all night!

=============================================================================

me:  This sounds so great, that it amazes me that it has not become
a _big_ deal, as in _the_ drug of choice for everybody in the world,
or at least everybody who has ever tried it.   $75/g wouldn't be a bad
price either, but I'm sure it would go up if it becomes popular.  (...got
damn,  why isn't it already???)


Hard to make?   That could be it.   Can somebody post the Methylamorex 
(sp?) abstracts and any stuff they have.  I want to find out about 
this chemical.   What name will it be under in Mercks?

=============================================================================

It should be fairly easy to make. At 1986 Rainbow Gathering in
Pennsylvania some people combined 4-methyl aminorex with LSD (stoopid!)
and had bad experiences, which gave the drug a bad reputation.
Popularity increase all over the world is predicted in the future. It was
put in Schedule I on October 15, 1987 after a seizure of a high
production lab in Florida. A fatality involving Euphoria has been
reported (Journal of Forensic Sciences 33:2 March 1988 pp 549-553),
allegedly after daily use for several months in combination with 
phenobarbital. In post-mortem analysis the concentration of U4Euh in
blood was found to be 21.3 mg/L (!). The guy who has been giving away 
Euphoria and info about it, The Friendly Stranger (you know those old 
'Beware!..' marijuana scare posters), seems to know his business pretty 
well (Psychedelic M&E vol 4).

When ingested orally the usual dosage is 15-30 mg as the free base
(18-36 mg as the HCl), onset of effects 1-2 hours, duration 14-16 hours. 
"Qualitatively, the experience is similar to a long-lasting MDMA intoxication
superimposed with methamphetamine, with the added benefits of easy 
verbalization, free association, integration and elaboration of previous
insights.." - The New Age Chemist, PM&E 4. Transient somatic effects: 
increased respiration, tachycardia, tremors, perspiration, increased blood
pressure, intraocular pressure, blurred visionand tightness in the chest.
Increased body and breath odor.

The stuff is called 4-methyl aminorex or 4-methyl-5-phenyl-2-amino-oxazoline.
