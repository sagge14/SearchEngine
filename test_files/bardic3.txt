And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

                                             IMPERIUM COMPOUND    
                                             (Atenveldt Verses)

   Now here's a story, a little bit gory,
   A little bit happy, a little bit sad.
   About a drink called Imperium Compound
   And how the SCA's been had!                       

   Chorus: Oh we think, we think, we think,
           The King is a fink, a fink, a fink,
           A figure of respectability
           Rules the Kingdom thru Imperium Compound
           The results are plain to see!

   Mongol Hordemen, those free-living swordsmen
   Subverting the Kingdoms from underneath!
   Have no use for Imperium Compound
   Except perhaps to brush their teeth!

   AltChorus: Oh we fink, we fink, we fink,
              The Khan and the Kink, the Kink, the Kink,
              And the Board, their Great Senilities!
              The Western Irgun, drinks Imperium Compound
              And we're BACK, with results you'll see!    

   Lady Laurel, with Authority Royal,
   Passes and rejects our heraldry
   She needs a swig of Imperium Compound
   Then perhaps she'd deign to talk to me!            

   Lady Trude thought it her duty
   To turn a social wrong into a Right
   Proved her point with Imperium Compound
   And showed that Cheshire Cats can fight!  //and scratch//

   The Board of Directors styled themselves The Electors
   And another con they tried to swing
   Now the BoD drinks Imperium Compound
   So we no longer need a King!                        

   AltChorus: Oh the Bod, the BoD, the BoD,
              It thinks it is God, is God, is God,
              The figure of Supreme Authority!
              And if we O.D.'d on Imperium Compund
              there'd be no need for Royalty!          

   Oh, MEDIEVAL Net, we thought it was all wet
   With witty remarks, and other kinds of sass
   We'll feed our computers on Imperium Compound
   And BYTE the BoD right on its' righteous ass!         

   Good old Duncan was often drunken
   Chasing all the ladies fair
   He bathed himself in Imperium Compound
   Now he has a little savoir faire!                     

                    (more)


  ATEN IMPERIUM (cont.)

   Ioseph of Locksley, never changes his socks, he
   Runs around looking like a Cavalier,
   He stocked up on Imperium Compound
   And he has enough to last for years and years!        

   AltChorus: Oh they forgot, forgot, forgot
              The Locks-e-ly Plot, the Plot, the Plot!
              And it works the best when it is underground!
              It isn't a hassle for a green-and-white tassle
              They're the ones that BREW Imperium Compound!  

   Trelon of the Wood, he was very good, he
   Was a leader that had never been beat before;
   But Caid had Imperium Compound,
   And Imperial Roman Caid won the War!  //with help!//   

   In Tyr Ysgithr, it's regularly whispered there
   That the Kingdom is ruled over by a King    // What's THAT? //
   They're "democratic" and quite erratic....
   They've forgot the purpose of the whole damn thing!     

   King Sir Mark von, with his pretty white suit on,
   Rules the Kingdom both with Grace and Purity!
   He never touches Imperium Compound
   At least not where anyone else can see!               

   Duke Sir Deaton, was never beaten
   On the field, or in the drinking hall;
   At the Catbox War with Caid,
   Left thirty bodies piled against the wall!             

   Denis O'Titans was good at smitin'
   A Locksley Monster in every single way!
   Drank a little Imperium Compound
   And ATE Deaton's sword that day  // No! REALLY! //

   But a nice guy none the less;

   Now he's Justin du Roc, I confess!

   Never touches Imperium Compound
