FUN TO BE HAD
-------------
         
        from the album SHOWTIME



Two and one make it three
Intertwine like the links that make a chain
'Round the anchor 'round a ship
'Round the bottom of the sea
'Round the world you and me
Back again and then it's us
With our life in our hands
Making one then making us
To be more to be sure
That what is here is here for you
Here for me, on and on
Into the night into the day
Into the years that are to come
More you know that I know
It's on and on, and on and on
You and me
You and us
To know and love and love again
On and on, on and on
The tiny thing that make us live
Through the day, through the night
Through the week or through our lives
Hand in Hand, look it up
Just sit and watch, toward the why
Gotta go, 'round the buoy
Can't think the light can go so far
On and on, on and on
To know and love and love again
On and on, on and on



Two and one make it three
Like a chain, an anchor
And a bed of the sea
Being close is where to be
Two minds, two bodies
An arrest you don't see
You got to see what we got to see
You got to find what we got to find
What you see is what you get
What you say should be from your own mind
Tiny things make us live
Through a day, through a night
A week, we got time to forgive
And live how we want to live
You got to see what we got to see
You got to find what we got to find
What's right,
What's free,
What's you, what's me?
This life, to live
Waste time and you don't forgive!
Whether you be glad, sad or bad
Whether you be glad, sad or bad
You've got to know that there's fun to be had!
You've got to know that there's fun to be had!
Forget all that you're told
You are young they are old
Control is all they got to give..
JUST LIVE HOW YOU WANT TO LIVE!
Tiny things that make us live..

Two and one make it three
Like a chain, an anchor
And a bed of the sea
Being close is where to be
With two minds, two bodies
An arrest you don't see
You got to see what we got to see
You got to find what we got to find
What you see is what you get
What you think should be from your own mind
What's right,
What's true,
Just think,
FOR YOU!
Whether you be glad, sad or bad
Whether you be glad, sad or bad
You've got to know that there's fun to be had!
You've got to know that there's fun to be had!
Whether you be glad, sad or bad
Whether you be glad, sad or bad
You've got to know that there's fun to be had!
You've got to know that there's fun to be had!
Whether you be glad, sad or bad
Whether you be glad, sad or bad
You've got to know that there's fun to be had!
You've got to know that there's fun to be had!
Whether you be glad, sad or bad
Whether you be glad, sad or bad
You've got to know that there's fun to be had!
You've got to know that there's fun to be had!

We are the boys we are the big boys
We're so strong
We're so pure
We know we are, we know we are

Win a set or get old

Such a violent playground
Such a violent playground

One Man's Burden
----------------
                  
        from the album SHOWTIME

Come on realize not a word..
Come on with arms open wide..
Its okay when its on TV
When its like the pictures in a book..
Its okay when its on TV
But it's you and me

Caught up in history
Tried to look but I just can't see
Someting is after me
Better run, I better run..
'Round and 'round
Over and over
To my duty by her
Correct heard..
I tried once and that was that
Now she knows I cant go back
Back to beginning
Over and over

Then she heard me say:
Been away and know I'm back                                
How's my credit and my credit's fine..
What will it be?
One man's burden playing out my mind
One man's burden got me just in time
One man's burden playing out my mind
One man's burden got me just in time
'Round and 'round
Over and over

She thinks I did it just to please myself
She thinks I did it just to be myself
Let's talk what to talk about..
Let's think what to think about..
Okay, well it's not okay
Straighten up, you gotta straighten up
Tell it straight, you gotta tell it straight
Come on,
One man's burden playing out my mind
One man's burden got me just in time
One man's burden playing out my mind
One man's burden got me just in time
'Round and 'round
Over and over
'Round and 'round
Over and over
'Round and 'round
Over and over

Hearts and Minds
----------------

      from the album BELIEF





You!
You are for you!
You!
You are for you!

Could it, could it be heart
Could it, could it be bone
This body rapture
This body rapture
You're wrapped up tight
You're wrapped up tight
Your empty words
Your empty soul
Your empty words
Your empty soul
You're you!
You!
You are for you!
You!
You!
You are for you!
You with your heart
You with your mind
Hearts and minds
Hearts and minds
Never again
No, never again
Never again
No, never again
Body's wrapped up tight
Body's wrapped up tight
Is it tight enough for..
You!
Heart and bone
Heart and bone
This could be it 
This could be you
This could be it 
This could be you
Your body jerks
Your body shakes
Your body jerks
Your body shakes
You're you!
You!
You are for you!
You!
You!
You are for you!


(and on and on..)
