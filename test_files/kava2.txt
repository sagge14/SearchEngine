[quoted text deleted]

i drank kava for two years while living in Fiji and suffered only
minor brain damage.  the doctors claim that it is reversible given
enough piracetam......oh, i'm just kidding, though i really did
drink the stuff for a couple of years there in the southern seas.

the drug comes from the roots of the _yaqona_ (pronounced "yang-gona")
plant, a bush that can grow quite large, though typically it is
harvested while only two or three feet high.  the roots are ground
using a rod and a hollowed log and the resulting powder is placed in a
cloth.  water is then poured through the cloth producing a brown or
grey musty- smelling liquid.

this is drunk ritually over the course of several hours, typically
in the evening while stories are told.

the drug is classified as a soporific, i believe, though mild
psychadelic effects have been reported.  the central causative agents
are called "yaquonaloids" or something like that, though there are
several hundred chemicals the effects of which are unknown.  the
premier study is by some ethnobotanists at U. of Hawaii.

in my experience, the physical effects include slight numbing of
throat and mouth early on, later the "grog drunk" can include mild
nausea and poor motor control.  the psychological effects are hard to
explain, although almost all users report relaxation and many claim
that social communication becomes easier, though the setting is
conducive to that anyway.  with heavy use, _kani kani_ or scaling of
the skin is often reported and can be disfiguring.  some reports have
suggested that this is the result of poor nutrition by "grog drunks".
dependence of various degrees is high among indigenous populations in
areas of Melanesia and Polynesia.  this is culturally acceptable
behavior among most peoples, however, and the only health officials
apparently concerned are in New Zealand where Mothers Against Drunk
Driving was heard to be lobbying for import restrictions in light
of a massive influx in recent years...so it goes.

  I have tried kava kava, but the mild high did not seem to warrant drinking th
e bitter tasting concoction. The following is a quote from "Intoxication: Life
in Pursuit of Artificial Paradise" by Ronald Siegel.
 
  "Tea made from kava roots is drunk cold but it still retains an attractive li
lac aroma. A pungent and numbing aftertaste keeps users from drinking too much.
 The intoxication is similar to alcohol in that it produces a short euphoric st
ate, relaxation, and some loss of social inhibitions. There is no hangover, eve
n for seasoned kava drinkers. But it is strangely disappointing to many who fin
d that while they are happy and content, thier mental alertness remains unaffec
ted. This would seem to be a benefit for problem drinkers but they balk at such
 unfamiliar sobriety and return to the dizziness of alcohol. To achieve stronge
r effects it is necessary to chew the kava root, a fibrous and unappetizing cou
rse that even native kava drinkers dislike. Furthermore, such high doses can be
 as addicting and as debilitating as alcohol."
 
  Any typos in the above passage are my own. As I understand it the kava root i
s legal and uncontrolled in the US, presumably because the intoxication is so m
ild. I have not heard of any liver damage from kava use, but it is possible. I
would be interested in hearing of the experiences of anyone else on the net reg
arding kava use.

  About your interest in Kava-Kava, from:

  "The Magical & Ritual Use of Herbs" by Richard Alan Miller


  Habitat:  Grows best up to 100 feet above sea level in cool, moist
 highlands or wet forests.  It will grow densly to 20 feet where summer
 temperatures are between 80 and 90 degrees F. with sufficient sunlight.

  Botanical Desc:  An indigenous shrub several feet high with heartshaped
 leaves and very short spikes arising from the base of the leaf-stems that ar
 densely covered with flowers.  The stem is dictiotomous, that is, two-forked,
 with spots.  The upper rhyzome is the part of the plant that is used and is
 starchy with the faint pleasant odor with a pungent bitter taste.
    Five varieties are cultivated in Fiji, three white and two black.  The
 white varieties are considered best source, but mature one year later than
the
 black.  The black are preferred for the commercial crop.

  (The book includes a history of Kava kava, but I'm skipping it for the
 useful parts, if your interested in any parts I skip, I'll include them
 some other time)

  Chemistry:  Active component in kava are six resinous alpha pyrones:
 kawain (C14H14O3) dihyrdokawain, methysticin (C15H14O5), dihydromethysticin,
 yangonin (c15h14o3) and dyhydroyangonin.  None of these are water soluable.

 Except when emulsified.  They are soluable in alcohol, oil and other fat
 solvents, including gastric juices.

 PRIMARY EFFECTS:  Small amounts produce euphoria; larger amounts produce
 extreme relaxation, lethargy or lower limbs and eventually sleep.  It does
 not impair mental alertness.  Often there are visual and auditory
 hallucinations (cool), lasting 2-3 hours with no hangover.  Kava is similar
 to marijuana (neat) as effects are not noticed when used for the first
 several times.  As a narcotic, Kava later produces numbing of the mouth,
 similar to cocaine.


 I can give you information on ritual use, preparation, and history if you
 are really interested.  This stuff if supposedly addictive after prolonged
 use, but so is orange juice.

  I thought I might as well include the other information on
 Kava kava as well.  Since someone emailed me on it and I lost his address.
  Here it is...


  Yeah, I don't really know where you could find kava-kava,
  as far as ordering it.  I haven't seen it up here in Washington state
  where I live.  I have a list of some companies which deal in supposedly
  "exotic" plants, you may want to try writing:

  Verenigde Nederlandse Kruidencooperative
  V.N.K. Postbus  1
  Elburg, HOLLAND

  Ask them for a catalog or something, let me know if you actually
  get one!  :)

  Here's the ritual use, history, etc.  As I said I would send:

  geographical location of kava:  Polynesia, Sandwich Islands, South Sea
  islands.

  HISTORY
  -------

   Kava kava has a history of religious and spiritual implications in the
  affairs of men.  The following legend summarizes man's relationship
  to the sun, sky, water, and earth as well as the "Divine Being" or mortal
  Self and the life cycle.  This is the alchemical marriage of fire, wind,
  water and earth to the spiritual "other" of the soul.

   The annual sun sacrifice of a girl of great beauty, Ui, was offered.  The
  Sun was so pleased he took her for his wife.  After a period, consent was
  given for her to return to her people to give birth to their Child.  Ui
  was sent flying through the sky and miscarried.  The fetus, however, floated
  upon the water and was cared for by a hermit crab.  The child, Tangaloa Ui,
  when he grew up, taught mortals how to make Kava as well as Reverence for
  the ceremony.

   Pava, the first mortal participant, had a son who laughed watching his
  father chew and spit the brew.  Tangaloa Ui, angry at the irreverance, cut
  Pava's son in two.  He then gave Pava the correct procedure.  Pava then
  offered the drink to Tangaloa Ui.  Instead of drinking it, Tangaloa Ui
  poured half of the brew on the head of Pava's uttering "Soyva" (Life)
  making the boy whole again.  The legend is continued as part of the kava
  ceremonies of the Samoans even today.


  PREPARATION
  -----------

  The part of the kava plant just below the surface of the ground reaches
 3-5 inches thich in 2 1/2-4 years.  After 6 years, the root will weigh
 as much as 20 pounds, after 20 years, 100 pounds.  After harvesting, the
 rootstocks are scraped, cut into pieces, and dried in the sun on platforms.

  Traditionally, the root was made into tea.  With the water-soluable
 components released, it acted as a mild stimulating tonic.  If the material
 is first chewed, then spit in a bowl and mixed with coconut milk, more
 powerful narcotic-type resins are released in emulsion.  For maximum effects,
 mix 1 ounce Kava with 10 ounces of water (preferably coconut milk), two
 tablespoons coconut oil or olive oil, and 1 tablespoon lecithin.  Blend until
 the liquid takes on a milky appearance.  Serves 1-2 people.

  Resins may be extracted with isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol in a heat bath.
 The solvent is removed by evaporation.  Redissolve in just enough warmed
 brandy, rum, vodka, or honey.  This is a more potent method because alcohol
 swiftly carrues the resins into the system.


  ***RITUAL USE***
  ----------------

  Kava's history and chemistry indicate that its euphoria qualities are best
 shared with special guests or friends.  The narcotic affects the "Feeling"
 centers where warm emotions are generated toward those involved in the
ritual.
 Therefore, Kava has been used as a sacrament for welcoming special guests
 and friends.
  The following ritual is designed for maximum results:

  a) Kava or its extracts should be pit into your finest glassware (or
  coconut cups if you have them) and served, to the most revered guests,
first.
  The bearer holds the cup at waist level with thumbs and index finger
  encircling the outside of the cup.

  b) The cup is then lifted to his forhead while in the center of the room.
  The cup bearer then stops four feet in front of the guests, let's the cup
  rest in his right palm and lowers his right hand with his left.  The left
  hand is placed behind this back while serving the cup to the guests. He then
  returns to the center of the room while the guest drinks.

  c) The guest receives the cup with both hands, pours a little kava onto the
  floor and says: "May our Guardians be with us today."  He raises the cup and
  says: "Life" and all others say: "Blessed Be."  He then drinks his kava in
  one gulp.  The others are then served.  They say nothing, but receive the
cup
  and drink in one gulp.

  d) If one accepts kava, but does not finish it, the remainder must be
  dicarded before returning the cup.

  e) When all have drunk, the lead guest says:
    "The ceremony is complete.  The bowl will hang with cup and strainer."
 Light food should then be served and the party started.

  NOTE OF CAUTION:
   Continual chewing eventually destroys tooth enamel.  Constant and excessive
   use of the fresh root with alcohol can become habit-forming and after
   several months resulting in yellowing of the skin, blooshot and weak eyes,
   emaciation, diarrhea, rashes, and scaly, ulcerous skin.  When discontinued,
   the symptoms disappear within two weeks.


 There it is... if you can get any more information than this, please let me
 know, I'm rather interested.

I would suggest that you try again. Kava has one of those weird reverse 
tolerance curves - it took four or five trys before I could notice anything 
from it. Also check the grade of Kava which you are using...waka grade tends 
to be the most potent of those available. Failing this follow Jeremys 
extraction as describes in the Australian Highs FAQ.

        how about the kava kava root?  you can get it at your most of
        those General Nutrition Center type places.  I've never done
        it myself, but I hear you steep it to make a tea, and drink,
        and voila!  numb.

kava is called a hypnotic/narcotic, but actually the effects are very
different from opioids.  i'd call kava more of a psychedelic,
actually.  one big difference is that your mind stays very clear after
drinking kava; you remain concious of what's going on around you and
notice some things you never noticed before.  kava also seems to make
you feel closer to other people, like mdma.  you feel like hugging
every stranger who walks by, you want to see hear feel their world
with them.  definitely it's relaxing, but it's a different kind of
relaxation that opiate "numbness".  i like kava a lot better myself.

also, you can't make kava into a tea since the active chemicals aren't
water-soluble.  the best way i've found to make a kava drink is to
grind up an ounce of root into a powder and mix it into some orange juice,
maybe with a little vodka or cognac or whatever too.  you swish the
drink around in your mouth a little, then swallow.  this makes your
mouth numb, like the novacaine they give you at the dentist.  the
taste also takes some getting used to.  since the active chemicals are
alcohol soluble, i guess you could also soak the root in vodka or
everclear for a while, then strain and drink it, but i've never tried.

     Someone the other day posted something on Kava root or extract.
I have heard of Kava from several different sources.  Several years ago
my grandfather (ex TWA pilot) told me a story once of some third
world place he was stationed at once. (possiably africa??) He said
they had drink there called Kava juice.  Basically it was an alcoholic
beverage that had some different side effects.  As well as giving one
a tipsy feeling, one also could experience numbing of the body.  One 
friend of his drank so much he couldnt walk or even feel his body!!
The next day the locals to the crew to the place were they make the 
drink.  Basically it was a bunch of women chewing on a root and spitting
in a bucket.  Then they would let is fermate, strain it, and there
you have Kava Juice!  
     I didnt really believe all of his story until a couple of years 
later when national geographic had a speacial on this place.  They 
showed the women spitting in the buckets!!  Well I was conviced.  
     Any way, someone said something about picking some up at a health 
food store and puting it in drinks and such.  Has anyone actually tried
this???  What about smoking it??? I think the TV special had something
about the natives also smoked it but I could be mistaken.

Travelled in Polynesia and Melanesia several years ago and drank
a lot of Kava. It is legal in the United States and Europe.
It is made from the ground root (and sometimes stem) of piper
methisticum, a pepper shrub that grows well on many tropical islands.
The root is either chewed in to a paste (by a virgin if you follow
the ceremonial rules), finely ground with an adapted coffer grinder
and infused throught cheese cloth, or pounded into a fine powder with
a large steel mortar and pestle (the Tongan method).
 
In all cases it is a ceremonial and social drink. In the Fijian
ceremony (where Kava is called Yangonna) a large bowl is made, a prayer
is said, and the serving begins. The server (only one person, the
host serves) fills the cup (made out of a half coconut shell) and passes
it to the man on his right (no women at the ceremony). The man
claps once before taking the cup, says "Bula" (pronounced m-bula), drinks
the whole cup in one gulp, and passes the cup back to the server. The
other participants then all clap thrice. The rotation is continued
ad infinitum, with the basic rules that you may refuse to be served,
and when you drink you must always finish the cup.
 
There are varying grades of kava, based on effect I'd say what is
available in the U.S. is one year old kava. The longer the plant
has been growing, the stronger the kava is. With what you can get around
here several cups of a normal preparation (1oz Kava to 3/4gal H20)
will give you a slight but pleasant buzz... numbness of extremities
and mouth, a slowness in the legs, and a generally relaxed feeling.
 
Vanuatu (producer of the world's best Kava) is supposed to
export high quality kava to the EC. Two cups of the good stuff can
really put you on your back.
 
If you smoke cigarets, remember your whole throat is numb, so you
can't really tell how large a drag you've taken.
 
Misc: Kava was/is used for village meetings, ceremonies to arbitrate
fueds (land rights, wars, etc... primitive society is no picnic). It
does seem to help conversation and avoid fights.
 
There are studies being done at the University of the South Pacific
(Yes, it does exist, main campus: Suva, Fiji. Extension schools
in every pacific island nation) concerning possible use
of Kava as an anti-viral/bacterial. It seems regions where Kava is
consumed have a much lower incedent of VD. I don't really thing this
means anything other than that these regions have ledd contact with
the outside world and follow Custom more.
 
The negative side: Well, try to place a long distance call at the
cable &wireless office in Suva... all the operators are in the
back room swilling Kava. Regular users (avoid using more
than 2-3 time/week) develop a scaly skin condition and are mocked
by their piers throughout polynesia. I do not know if this condition
is permanent.
 
The fijians do consider it medicine as well, and it did seem to
keep the symptoms of Dengue Hemoragic Fever in check.
 
Plusses: Nonaddictive, no hangover.
 
Hope this helps the Kava Curious. For those is Massachusets,
Asenic & Oldlace (witchcraft store... creepy) in Cambridge
on mass ave between harvard and porter sqs. has it in stock
most of the time.

Thought some people interested in ethnopharmacology would like to
readthe following...

KAVA
Although beer has largely replaced kava as the major intoxicating brew
of Polynesia, kava bars are still quite common.  This beverage made
from the shrub PIPER METHYSTICUM was for centuries venerated amon the
communities of the idyllic islands of Polynesia.  It was originally
prepared exclusively by children, who would collect the roots and
lower stems of teh shrub, chew them, and then spit the soggy mass into
a communal bowl.  The salivary enzymes were clearly important for the
release of the psychotropic constituents marindin and
dihydromethysticin, from the vegetable matrix.  The dried residue was
then mixed with water and the extrat was straned to produce kava.  The
mode of preparation is essentially the same today.

A measure equivalent ot a half-full split coconut shell is sufficient
to produce a state of well-being and somnolence, althoughlarger
quantities may induce a quarrelsome state and even drunken behaviour.
This was too much for the missionaries and the tried with some success
to rid the island of this unholy brew.

The mode of actionof kava is completlely unknown, though the chemical
structures of the main constituents have some structural similarity to
those from nutmeg, and like these they may be metabolized to
amphetamine-like compounds.

Wow, I have never seen this before.  Unfortunately many things are
not true in it.  They do know the active constituents, and they
are listed in one of the FAQ's going around.  Originally, they thought
that salivary enzymes somehow allowed the kava to "ferment", but
later studies have shown that it is the emulsification of the resins
from the chewing action that activates the kava, not enzymes.
I have never, ever read in any text other than this that kava can
produce a quarrelsome state and even drunken behaviour.   The
missionaries wanted to stop the kava drinking because it was an integral
part of the Polynesians' religion, not because of the effects it had
on them.  The effects of kava are very, very different than those
of amphetamine, or their analogs.  That is a pretty recent book to
have such old and wrong information.

The Kava Kava extracts sold in health food stores are alcohol-based.  When you
add it to water, it's really weird; it turns milky yellow and swirls around
like crazy of its own accord.  Really strange.

Taken in moderate quantities--say, half a coconut-shell--two or three 
times a day, kava induces a pleasant, lax, bland sort of stimulation,
more active than tea, and more lasting, followed by a doze that may last
an hour or so.  Larger doses, instead of inducing peaceful reflection,
are sufficiently stimulating to make the subject jumpy or even 
quarrelsome.  Drunkenness is not unknown among a minority of heavy 
kava drinkers. . .

(end excerpt)

 This may very well be bullshit, but at least there was some precedent
for what Mann was writing.  In fact it sounds so similar that I would
guess Mann was referring to Taylor's book or that they had a common
primary source.  Taylor's book is not especially scholarly or 
convincing, especially in its ethnobotanical parts, so if Mann was
using it as a reference it reflects poorly on him.

When I was in polynesia Kava was almost always drunk in great quantities
(15 half coconut shells in a night) never saw any fights from it. I don't
see how you could fight since your arms and legs become quite heavy after
a few cups.

Actually, methysticin has the same 3,4-methylenedioxy ring substitution.
If you lop off the lactone ring and add dimethylamine across the double
bond, you have MDMA.  Interesting, given your comments.

Those interested in learning more about Kava-Kava (Piper methysticum)
would do well to dig up Singh YN (1992).  KAVA: AN OVERVIEW.  Journal
of Ethnopharmacology, 37, 13-45.

It is an interedisciplinary article so it should be of interest to
those from a chemical, pharmacological, ethnological and sociological
background.  The information is current, and includes photos and a
documentary of the Kava ritual.

for those that are just interested in finding another
psychoactive...this seems to be a good one to try.  alcohol or acetone
extractions (a combination of one then the other repeated several
times then hot extractions) will do (Merck Index).  Unfortuantely the
constituents (and there are many that appearantly act synergistically)
are not water soluble...then how did the peoples of oceania come to
use this herb ritually?  ah...i don't want to give the ending away

When in the South Seas I did learn the trick to Kava, drink lots of it.
I recommend putting between an ounce to two ounces of kava in a fine,
mesh, cotton sack to make the infusion. Use up to a gallon of water. Mush
that sack around the water till it is opaque, really, really opaque.
Take a small tea cup (the closest equivalent to a half coconut shell
I can find) and fill it 3/4 full with the gritty liquid. Drink it
down all at once. Do this four or five in the first twenty minutes of
drinking. Then drink a cup every ten or fifteen minutes. When you get
up to go to the bathroom in about an hour you should notice that your
legs are a bit heavy, your extremities a bit numb.
  It seems that drinking this is universally disliked by north americans,
but when I was in Fiji there was no way to avoid it without offending
my hosts. Actually I like the stuff... It just makes me feel kind of
good. You may also find that you have very vivid dreams that night
  Remember Kava drinking is a social and ceremonial activity. You don't
drink kava and go to a movie. You drink kava all night while talking
with a group of friends. If there is demand for a FAQ on how to
perform a Kava Ceremony I could be induced to write one up.
