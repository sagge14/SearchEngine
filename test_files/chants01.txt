ASCII MUSICAL NOTATION
developed by Leigh Ann Hussey
with help from Shadowthought and Josh Gordon

Each line of the music consists of 4 lines of music.  The time signature(s),
the lines between bars, and each note take up one column, with modifiers such
as sharps, flats, and dots extending a note up to three columns.  The time
signature is written at the beginning in the obvious way.  Three vertical bars
(lines 2 to 4) mark the divisions between measures.  Lines 1 to 3 indicate
note durations, as follows:

     1/16   1/8   1/4   1/2   dotted-1/2   1/8    1/4
     note   note  note  note     note      rest   rest
      =      _
      |      |     |     |        |         '      %
      |      |     |     o        o.

Line 4 indicates the pitch.  The numbers 1 to 8 mark the octave including
middle C (A through F);  1' to 8', one octave above middle C;  1" to 8", two
octaves above middle C; '1 to '8, the octave below middle C. A number followed
by a # is a sharp; a number followed by a lower-case b is a flat.  Underscores
connecting a note to the next note indicate a slur.  Consider the following
examples:

Deity; 'va' is energy, the manifested or female side of Deity. This mantra
represents the whole course of the Universe, from Zero through the finite back
to Zero."
