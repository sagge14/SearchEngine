Alternative Tentacles Records
-----------------------------

        I bet most of you have never heard of Alternative Tentacles 
Records.  They are a relatively small record company that deals mostly
in alternative and hardcore punk music.  It is owned and operated by a
man named Jello Biafra. He used to be the lead singer of one of the
greatest punk bands to ever exist, the Dead Kennedys.  Definitely on par
with the Sex Pistols in pioneering the punk field.  He is still going
strong with several new projects and singing with a lot of different bands.
He has had several albums out since the break up of the Dead Kennedys after
going to trial for a piece of art from a famous artist named H.R. Giger.
Some of these albums are:

Lard: Power of Lard
Lard: The Last Temptation of Reid (new)
Jello Biafra with D.O.A.: The Last Scream Of The Missing Neighbors (new)
Jello Biafra and NOMEANSNO: untitled

        Jello is also sponsoring The No Censorship Fund based out of
the offices of Alternative Tentacles Records.  If you want any information
about Alternative Tentacles, or The No Censorship Fund, then send

Newspapers

        A few semesters ago, there were around six rapes within a 3 month
span on the ISU campus.  If you will think back, you will notice that 
you didn't read about this in the Indiana Statesman or the Tribune Star.
In fact, you didn't read about thin in ANYTHING!  ISU is a very power-
ful state institution that gets what it wants when it wants it.  What
does this say about our opressive government?  Half of the people 
reading this will probably forget about it tomorrow, or just don't
give a damn now.  What does that say about our society and what it does 
to it's offspring?
        We wouldn't want to print something bad about our lovely state
owned and operated campus now would we?  We wouldn't want to say anything
about the hella lame police force that can't stop rapes from happening
because they are too busy eating doughnuts and chasing skateboarders.
The worst part about the whole damn thing is the fact that it was
all smoothed over and forgotten about.  If people aren't informed of
the past, then the past repeats itself.  How many more of those girls
do you think would have been raped if the first one would have been
talked about?  Start watching for this kind of thing to happen from
now on.  It happens all of the time.

The Information Crunch
----------------------

        This article will only cite a couple of examples of our
wonderful government trying to stop us from getting information they
deem unlawful for us to possess. This is a violation  of our 
constitutional rights. Only a few can be cited from the simple fact
that there are too many to talk about!  The sheep are easier to drive 
when they don't know they are going to the slaughterhouse.
        First of all, I will mention a little something about NBC news.
If you follow the lines of ownership back, you will find that NBC is 
a subsidiary of RCA records (another form of information distribution),
which is in turn owned by General Electric.  General Electric is the 
largest manufacturer of nuclear arms and nuclear power in our country.
What I ask of you, the reader, is to see if you can find anything about
accidents with nuclear waste or spills on the NBC news.  What you might
also want to look for is RCA artists (still employed by RCA) singing
about nuclear weapons and/or toxic waste.  John Denver was dropped
from the RCA record label right after he released an album that spoke
out against nuclear arms.
        Our friends, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have 
been going on a rather large witch hunt to destroy a very popular
underground computer magazine called Phrack.  A little history 
on Phrack seems to be in order here for those of you who are 
unfamiliar with the publication.  Phrack stands for Phreak/Hack.
Phreaking is the art of knowing just what buttons to push and what 
tones to send when having phun with the phone company.  Hacking is
NOT what the TV programs portray it to be.  Hacking is dealing with
very competent computer users who are able to find security holes in 
large computer operating systems and networks.
        This magazine was started by two hackers with the aliases
Taran King and Knight Lightning.  It is many years old and was first
made on old Apple II computer systems.  The magazine spread information
to the computer underground, which by the time it was out, the information
was no longer useful.
        The FCC has now forcibly entered the homes of the phrack writers,
taken their computer systems (never to return them), and stolen
their mailing lists.  The FCC is also going through the mailing list
busting anyone who subscribed to the magazine for possessing the 
information.  However, the law states that holding information is
not unlawful, but the use of information to perform illegal actions
is unlawful.  They ARE getting away with this, and nobody is doing
anything about it.  If you would like to see the Phrack that talks
about the busts (they didn't get them all!), then drop us a line
to our P.O. box in the back of this rag, and we can make arrangements.
Leave us a phone number and a first name.  We can also give you any
issue number of any underground computer magazine, we have them all.
Activist Times Inc., Computer Underground Digest, Phun, Pirate, Narc,
and Papers.
        Here is a little note I would like to leave you to think
on before I end this article.  Take a look at any new elementary
or junior high school text book and see how much information you 
can find on the United States dropping the bomb on Hiroshima.  It's
not even mentioned!

Smack Attack
------------

        Our government has a philosophy.  If they pull off a dirty deed
and nobody finds out for 15 years, then it becomes so much worthless
paper. I assume everyone has heard of the facts behind the movie Air
America.  During the Viet Nam War, the CIA smuggled smack into the 
United States with a bogus airline called Air America.  Now, the 
government does not care if you know.  That was 15 years ago, right?
Wrong!  that might very well be today.  What is supposed to make us
think anything has changed?  They can smuggle in drugs now better than
they could then.  The drugs make good fuel to feed the "drug crisis"
fires at home so the people will think their government is looking out
for them.  From the knowledge that the government used people to test
the effects of LSD on in the 60's we can come to the conclusion that
they know more about it and it's possible uses than we do.  It could
be very possible that people are much easier to control when their
brain is thrashed on drugs.  Just say no?  Say no to drugs, or no to 
your government?  We need change!  We need a government that cares,
and so does the rest of the world.

The Temple Of Sheep
-------------------

        Well, if you haven't thrown this away yet, then we would like 
to thank you for reading!  Consider yourself and open minded person.
this is my "tidying up" article to attempt to strengthen my beliefs
and observations I have put forth in the earlier articles.
        There are so many lies and cover ups going on in the world today,
that it is difficult to tell what is truth and what is fiction.  Most
of our baby kissing politicians spend their time trying to find loop
holes in the Constitution (or just plain ignoring it altogether) in
order to tighten the noose of militarism.  If they can't get around
the constitution, then they just use economical black mail.  If you
know what happened to the 7-11s and Wall Mart, then you will know what
I am talking about. The philosophical disease of trying to keep the 
peasants productive has gone on for too long.  It seems it is too late 
to turn it around.  This isn't true.  If enough people jump on the band 
wagon, we could save ourselves before we all drown.
        As children, the system works through it's slow-to-build 
prototypes (the previous generation) to try and control our thoughts
and actions.  As you grow up, you begin to like the blinders you are
wearing and just look upon our governments actions with adoring eyes
never pierce that false shell of kindness.  When you finally get put
into your "chosen" profession, you work the best years of your life
away in order to exist.  There are too many things missed, and too
little shared.  as you grow older and a little less productive, you 
start to reach retirement age.  Oh yes, the golden years, when you
turn 65, start trying to live off of social security and if you're lucky,
a pension.  All those years of work to be thrown out in the end to die
alone.  Just like the sheep model society has molded you into.

What's the Point?
-----------------

        I'm sure some of you are thinking of a few questions you would
like to ask us or have something you wold like to point out.  We would 
like to clear up a few things right away to maybe clear up a couple
of possible questions.
        You probably noticed a lot of these articles are pretty vague
about some things.  These weren't meant to tell you what is right and
what is wrong.  They were meant to cast a "shadow" of our thoughts onto
your thinking.  The main point, however, was to make you start to think
and maybe open up your eyes and your mind a little wider before you take
a look at the world.
        We've gotten a lot of hell in the past for speaking out, and we
have done this kind of thing before.  As long as there are people that
get pissed off because our views our different or wrong in their eyes,
than we will keep publishing.  You can call us names, or chase us down,
but that won't change us, and we stand by our values.  We are out of
step with the world and not ashamed of it.

         --the crew

If you are interested in mailing us your questions, comments, or even
articles of your own, then go for it.  We have obtained a post office
box for this purpose.  Who wants to give out our real address, we would
probably get killed!  Oh yeah, if you are after us now, you might as well
give up trying to go through the P.O. box, dead end there...  If you send
us an article, don't expect it to be printed, we can't print them all.  
However, we will start a regular letters to the editor(s) column and will
print plenty of letters.  Later, and have fun...

Out Of Step With The World An Enhanced Scream For Reality

                           ------------

     This article is dedicated to metalheads, racist/fascist
skins, homophobes, and senseless, violent assholes who think
they know where it's at.  Whatever possessed you to come into the 
punk/hardcore scene?  Yeah, maybe when punk started getting 
publicity in 74-75 some of the exposed bands put a bad rap on 
themselves by being obnoxious on T.V. and screaming the simple 
term "anarchy" with no real definition behind it.
     Eventually, hardcore came out in the 80's.  Bands who were 
punk in some ways, "hippy-like" in other ways were singing 
intelligent lyrics about peaceful world unity.  Anarchy and peace, 
freedom of expression, smashing racism, and doing away with 
oppressive governments.  Well, that was then and this is now.  I 
guess that is all I can say now in disappointment.
     When the metal and skinhead type attitudes popped into the 
scene around 84 or so, things started to go down the drain.  Yes 
folks, the time had come to take off your "thinking" caps and put 
on your football helmets and kick some ass.  Do you realize how 
hard it is to tell some of the metal/punks out there what 
anarchism really means?  It's like talking to a jackass.  Then 
again, a jackass is a little smarter. Talking to the nazi skins and so 
called anti-racists, proud American skins is like talking to a 
pre-programmed robot.  So, take your stupid homophobe, racist, 
violent, bald headed ideas and rub them in a pile of bullshit 
where you and your ideas belong.
     Remember when shows used to have real pits.  Some bouncing 
every which way, occassionally see your friend bounce by, help 
each other when you fall?  Now it's "mosh dude", run in a boring
ass circle and stomp on those who fall down.
     Punk is on it's life support machine again.  Can it be saved?  
Or are you going to let those who think anarchy means violence, 
peace sucks, anti-everything different, fake skinhead fuckers take 
over our scene?  I'm not.  If you aren't either than that's one 
step forward.  Then you just get a friend to believe that, and 
he/she to do the same and we're on the way to bringing our scene
back to what it was.  Peaceful, nihilistic anarchism.  Freedom to 
all, love to all (even the people I've just spoken against, maybe 
they'll wise up) and up with individualism.

Old Pink On Everything
   Let me start by saying I was going to bang off about 8 million little
articles on a lot of topics, but I opted for a few real long articles that
ramble.  So, as co-editor, I will ignore the Chicago and the AP & UPI and
the New York Times... I am in control, so I will ramble.

NOMEANSNO:  This is a group that has a lot to say.  I only have a few of
their works, but they rule.  Small Parts Isolated And Destroyed and WRONG
are the two I have, and from this sample (hell, it's 50% of their discography)
I think this band will go far.  We couldn't categorize them, so I just called
it psychopunk.  I guess it fits.

Tipper Gore / PMRC / Religious Right / Jello Biafra:
This is one topic that gets me hot: censorship.  If you listen to the people
talk, they sound reasonable; it's not like putting a label on a record
stopped it from being produced, right?  WRONG.  John Denver, super mellow guy,
got kicked off his label for telling the Tipper Squad to stuff it.  Not saying
this is bad or anything of that nature, I'm sure he'll do well, but to quote
"If John Denver tells you you have your head up your ass, isn't it entirely
possible you have your head up your ass?"  Someone as lame and innocent as
that gets the axe, and it's not censorship.  Something doesn't connect here.

So the PMRC hearings got our pal canned, and produced some startling non-
revelations: who funds the PMRC?  Where does the cash come from?  A clue:
your tithing brothers of Gawd.  The Religious Right sees fit to quash any
type of thought that does not follow the conventions of the church, and they
do so under the guise of 'concerned parents'.  Who wouldn't give a sawbuck
to hear a concerned mom bitch about evil music? Who got all this going,
anyway?  Who released the studies to get the ball rolling?

The Ku Klux Klan.

The KKK released the original reports of the affectations, which caused the
music of 'the negro' to be banned from 'white' airwaves.  This persecution &
prosecution of music continued on into the 80's, where Tipper says that the
music of the occult underground is driving our kids to do heinous things.
Right.  I was doing heinous things long before I ever heard of the Dead
Kennedys.

I really am just paraprhasing Jello, so I'd ask you all to buy a tape or two:
(1) Jello Biafra Spoken Word Album, and Jello Biafra Tales Of the Trial.
(2) Some DK tape (pick one, my fav is Frankenchrist).

If you know me, ask me to borrow (BORROW) my copies... I'll loan you the
disks,and make you ill.

Oh yes: the Religous Right, they funded the publication of Tipper's book.
That's a tie-in I forgot.

GET STUPID GET VIOLENT:  When you read this, and you get hot, and want to kick
our asses and show us who's tough, don't.  Go put out your own paper, or hold
talks.  I'm trying to get Jello to come to Terre Haute (dre-e-e-e-eam...) to
speak to ISU, but if I can't I want to say what I think is important without
getting the shit knocked out of me.  If you disagree with us, write us, get
a hold of us, mail us on the nets... do something.  But don't prove us right
by trying to nail us.  We already think you need awakened or we wouldn't be
doing this.  Don't show you're too stupid to learn to listen.

I sk8 Hardc0re, don't tell me I d0n't:
Well, OK bud, but I'd like to talk about some shit that everyone on this
campus think's cool but isn't.  It's skate harassment.  I skate a little,
and I get tired of the shit spewing from the preppy asses in low riding trucks
painted stupid colors with plastic regular fucks in the seat beside them.
What's a real gas is you don't stop and back yourself up, you just yell and
run.  that's weak.  When we say come back, it's not a bluff.  Come back and
we'll fight back, but I have yet to see a skate go 60 so we can't catch you.
It's the perfect crime, but what's funny is when we attack YOU.  You run and
grab about 80 drug crazed stupid fucking preps who run up, yell, and run
off.  You're sad.  Fight back or go away.

Racism:
new hot topic, racism in the schools.  It's real, folks, and I'm just world
weary enough to know one article in some degenerate publication isn't going
to change your views, but I ask you to think next time you let loose with a
big string of 'goddamnniggerfuckingsonofabitchingassholejunglemonkeychick
wetbackchinowearinggoon' into the world, you look to see who's standing
next to you.  They might not like it.  And you may find out what it's like
to eat a knuckle sandwich.

'liberals'
Here's one that really pisses me off, these self deemed liberals that are
so right wing they make Nixon look good.  I work with one, let's call her
Margret.  Oh that's her real name, oops.  Well her ideas are that music is
too free, the government needs to clamp down on this porno-rock, that Jesse
Helms rules, that Penthouse readers should be prosecuted, and the
newspapers need to be shut up.  AND THEN she has the gall to say 'but I'm a
liberal on these issues'.  She's not the first one I've met, and probably
not the last.  Not even the worst, just the most recent.  I'd just ask if
you must hold views, stick up for yourself and slip into your niche.  Don't
pose, say 'I'm a conservative' not 'liberal except for speech' or whatever.
arg.

MINOR THREAT
A cool band that broke up a long time ago, real harDCore, the complete
discography is $9 at headstone's.  so go buy it, it's fast and hard as hell.

PYROTECHNICS
OK you're bored and you need to warm up the night. do this safe thing in a
field or something, it's cool and painless and expensive.  take a pound of
gunpowder (or less, depends you know) and pour it in a big pile on some
wood.  then pack 50 pounds or so of flour on top of it, and stick in the
fuse.  reverse the last two steps, oops... then light and get back! makes a
hella big fireball.  real big, real quiet, and real bright.  make sure the
flour is real dry, too.  l8r...

living in terre haute
ok my damn shift key broke so now it's all lower case.  first, go to
headstone freind's at 12th and poplar or thereabouts.  real cool place,
head shop, record store, totally cool.  just get up the balls to go in,
don't talk about it DO IT!
to eat: go to sam's wholesale club (get a pal with a card) and buy a
shitload of food and grub out. they rule for cheap bulk food, like bulk
snicker's bars and cases upon cases of cola.  but no cherry coke...
fun: go to bloomington. ok, maybe cruise the bash or get drunk or
something. sorry, if you knew me... inside joke.  but seriously folks, the
Ritz in indy is a place to see concerts.

Here, boys and girls, practice censorship yourself. Here is some text a lot of
people would like to see not here, and you can take you pens and lipstick
and smear it right out of existance.  Try it, censorship is FUN!

      1st Amendment
      Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of 
      religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging 
      the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the 
      people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for 
      a redress of grievances. 

We started you off, just in case scribbling on the constitution puts
you off. But as long as you don't vote Tipper's husband out...

Have we got a telethon for you coming soon on MTV, a rock and bankroll
extravaganza featuring all your favorite vigilante rock stars: Sammy
Hagar, Sylvester Stalone, Clint Eastwood! This telethon is so important
that we've even exhumed the bodies of Lynard Skynard!  This ain't no
sissy concert to raise money for food for the needy, this concert is  
whipped up the American way to raise money for guns for the greedy!
So stay tuned and dig in those heels, for USA for South Africa!  It's
USA for South Africa, because those poor, sex starved aparthied riot
battalions need MORE machine guns, MORE tear gas, MORE nerve gas and
MORE electric fences for those prison camps they call "HOMELANDS".
And who's gonna give it to them?  WE ARE! Every one of us. Every
time we go to the bank, every time we buy food at Leftway's, or those
fancy chome wheels for YOUR hot car it's USA for South Africa!
Don't delay! Apartheid is a BIG business! What would those American
ladies do wihtout those diamonds?  You heard the WHITE House, don't
miss it!  Have you rich parent's money ready world hunger's gone for
ever once your check's in the mail when MTV and the Rock And Racism
Connection bring you live, from Sun City, USA for South Africa!

POETRY CORNER.

Song of the Sea, a pleasant memoir

I ventured to the land of Texas/To watch the sea tumble over the sand
what I watched instead/was the waste of man.

The sun rose and set over the sea/The black cloudy water washed over me
I slid into the Gulf of Mexico/And landed in waste from Texaco

I thought life wasn't so bad/In younger years I wasted
But the world is small,/the land basted.

When the water was green or clear/Man fished and swam, never fearing
The hydrotoxic holocaust/They were breeding.
The sea is dead and rotting/the world is turning black
All the while the fisherman/Are stabbing us in the back.

---These pleasant thoughts provided by Xanthroid.
the endtroduction
well, it looks like we managed to bang out our first edition in a record
one year since inception.  Actually, the idea goes back to NFP 1989, but
this is the new revised, more liberal view.  I guess I'm done rambling.

one more lyric (DK):
some guy in sacremento was dragged into court
he shot his lawnmower 'cause he said it wouldn't start
might makes right it's the american way
they fined him fifty dollars and sent him on his way
you know some people
don't take no shit
maybe if they did, they'd have half a brain left!

No I lied, here it is quite a few weeks after this was supposed to come out but
NO, I quit my job and lost my photocopier access. Sucks! So here it is, me
rambling on about religion and shit again. Sorry to bore.

Religion:
I was walking to the bookripoffcenter the other day, and there was this
guy there, yelling about god and all that shit.  So, I took it upon myself
to yell back.  I was the guy in the grey trenchcoat ans shorts, if you were
there.  I was offering some serious alternatives to religion; all this guy 
could come back to my questions with was some wiseass crack about wearing
shorts in the cold.  I asked him questions, and all he did was yell about god.
Lame. My alternatives were these:
   1) don't believe in god, believe in yourself. You, and only you,
      have the power to make yourself a better person.  No god will
      show you a better path, it's up to you to make one. There are
      no wrong and right ways to do it, folks. Just follow your own
      ideas.  Don't sell your mind for the euphoria of belonging
      to a group of sheep.  Sure, you're always welcome, but you
      sure do get the hairy eyeball for not putting a little something
      in the plate.  HMMM? You know, the principle of the collection
      plate was to take if you were needy and give if you could, and
      to be humble and not worry about it if you were on the giving or
      recieving side.  So next time you go to church, count the homeless.
      Count the destitute.  If I showed up on your doorstep, you'd call
      the cops.  You're afraid of YOURSELF the most.  When you raise your
      voice at your kids, doesn't it raise doubts in your head? 

CRACK YOUR MIND OPEN

What Happened???
----------------

	When I look back on the salad days, I remember I used to have
a lot of friends in grade school.  Real friends, not like the 
superficial ones everyone seems to have today.  We all played together
and had a lot of fun at school.  No one really seemed to belong to 
a group.  We were all just together.  
	Then we all reached junior high school.  Things weren't so
fun anymore.  People started paying attention to who had the best
clothes and the most money at lunch time.  It started to seperate into
groups.  We didn't talk together so much because we wouldn't want our
new and better friends to disown us for our other friends.
	Well, now we are through with junior high and we go to high
school.  All kinds of new people here.  I guess we better make a much
bigger impressions to get better friends.  Pay for our friendship,
that is the only way.
	We got into much more defined groups and decided not only not
to talk to each other anymore, but to hate each other.  It was much 
easier than putting on the fake smile.  We have to think about our
new friends and our careers, we don't have time for the other people.
	Now we have reached college.  This is the most important 
phase of our life.  We must impress everyone.  We have to choose our
groups wisely.  It is tough to decide which fraternity/sorority to 
join.
	As I see it, this is all a bunch of shit.  I see my old 
friends from long ago at college still.  I try to at least greet
them, maybe things can be how they were.  They decide to ignore me.
I don't understand, I though friendship was much more important than
a group of superficial friends all striving to impress the others with
the newest car and the biggest stereo.  He who chugs the mostest, 
becomes the bestest.  You bet!  Why can't everyone just be friends
and not try to see who has the biggest wallet and most "friends?"
What happened to everyone?

Economic Genocide: Strawberry flavour available.

	We all know what is happening to the world.  The environment
is going down the tubes.  Toxic waste is killing the wildlife, and 
it is killing us as well.  When the low elements of the food chain 
die, we all die.  Environmentalists are trying their hardest to stop
it all from happeneing by attacking the big corporations who are 
destroying the Earth where we all have to live. 
	I have a message for all of the environmentalists out there:
You are attacking all the wrong people.  You are one very small step
off.  We have to stop the powers behind it all.  The politicians are
the ones at the top.  We have to stop the people who let the 
companies get away with it.  They not only let them get away with it,
but they tell them to do it.  Their pocket books are much more important
than the human race.
	We should all go out and vote.  Vote for who?  One politician
is just as corrupt as they other.  They may not start out to be, but
they get that way.  All you need is a big wallet, and god in your 
pocket, and you can do anything.  Let a company dump a little toxic
waste, then go to church on Sunday and ask god for forgiveness for your
sins in the name of the economy and your conscience goes away.
	Hell, a little toxic waste never hurt anyone.  At least it
keeps the population from producing.  Less people, more money to go 
around.  If you haven't noticed, we have a recession going on.  What
a perfect time to start a little war.  Hell, why not pick the Middle
East, they are always doing something over there that big brother 
doesn't like.  Just ship a few marines over and all of those thousands
of years old racial disputes just go away.  Uncle Sam knows what is 
right for the world and the economy.  How many times have similiar 
"uprisings" happened in the Middle East?  Kuwait just happened at 
a perfect time.  We can save the economy with a nice handy little 
war.  I have some news for you all, we have to save our own asses
before we can save Kuwait.  The government isn't trying to save
Kuwait in the name of humanity, they are trying to save it in the 
economy.
The government is trying to control the economy through the war in
Kookwait, and trying to cover up its lack of ability to deal with
our debts, both monetary and humanitarian, by feeding 'endless doses
of sugar coated mindless garbage' in the form of Madonna ads, where
she uses sex and cavorts about trying to get you to join the American
way, join the people and VOTE for ????  OK, so I vote and get laid?
Interesting... getting laid is on everyone's mind, and the government
is out there trying to hide the fact that all this SEX is destroying us.
Don't get me wrong here, but there is an insidous diease running around,
killing off scores of folks... maybe you know someone with AIDS.  You
will soon, if you don't now.  In a book entitled "The Truth About AIDS",
some doctors from the CDC (Center for Disease Control) and other places
told the public what's up on AIDS.  But the government, the same one
that YOU voted in, killed the book.  How? It's not hard. Audit a company,
cook the books... and nail them.  This book is now underground... try 
to buy it at Walden's.  They'll look real confused and say 'duh, nope!'
AIDS IS KILLING!  People are DYING.  Just because the government owned presses
have stopped talking about AIDS, it doesn't mean it's gone away.

Someone once said (No Bartlet's... DAMN) that the job of the people was
to overthrow the goverment once it got to far away from the people. It's
our JOB to see that the truth gets out. It's YOUR job.  I've been seeing an
increased police presence in the city for a little while... what's up?
Someone tell us.

Religion: Ain't it the shits?
Dija read the one about the kids whose parents wouldn't let him go to the
doctor to have a bowel obstruction removed, and tried to faith-heal it away?
He died for the want of some ex-lax, and now the state is suing his parents
for child abuse. What do you think? I think it was the kid's right to live
that outweighed his parent's beliefs in non-medicine, but hey, who am I?

Then there's the one about the guy who canned his family for not being in
the way of god.  His livacious, lustful daughter was to far gone.  So he
killed them all.  Here's a good article: Penthouse, August 1990 issue,
the atrticle is called Holy Horrors.  It's a neat one, a real gem. Fun at
parties, too!
