*******************


                            Procedure
                           ***********

1) Add Glucose to Liceriouse Powder. (The ratio is for every 2 ounces of
L.P add 1 ounce of glucose)

2) Add to a hot drink or some food. Stand back because this stuff realy
makes them break wind!

Note:
Instead of using glucose you can use corn syrup. Licerouse Powder I have no
idea how to get.

HAVE PHUN! Remember April Fool's day is coming up!
