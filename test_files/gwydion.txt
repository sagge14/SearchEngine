                   Metempsychosis
                   --------------
I doubt all, save the survival 
Of some unquenchable fire within me;
I seek no immortality,
For it comes without search.
I live with the joy of my senses,
Knowing that this part will surely perish,
Leaving only that which came before.
To live here and now, without that certainty,
Without the acceptance of Death as the unveiling of the One,
Is to forget,
Forever,
The secret name that is whispered at birth
Beyond the hidden gates.
