        And now we have got to The End
        Of this song about Terrible Sin
        And if you've been bored
        I'm sorry, m'lord
        You should NEVER have let me begin!         (I)

        He could pray and be calm
        'Neath a pleasant date-palm,
        While the lice on his pecker ran races!       (S)

        The last time I dined with the King
        He did quite a curious thing:
        He sat on a stool
        And took out his tool,
        And said, "If I play, will you sing?"         (S)

        The gay young Duke of Buckingham
        Stood on the bridge at Rockingham,
        Watching the stunts
        of the cunts and the punts,
        and the tricks of the pricks that were fucking 'em!  (S)

        A mathematician named Ball
        Had a hexahedronical ball,
        And the cube of its' weight
        Times his pecker, plus eight,
        Was four-fifths of five-eighths fucking all!   (S)

        There was a young student of Trinity
        Who shattered his sister's virginity
        He buggered his brother,
        Had twins by his mother,
        And took double honours in Divinity!       (S)

        There was a young fellow named Scott
        Who took a girl out on his yacht
        But, too lazy to rape her,
        He made darts of brown paper,
        Which he languidly threw at her twat!      (S)

        There was a young lady from Exeter
        So pretty, that men craned their necks at her
        One went so far
        As to wave from his car
        The distinguishing mark of his sex at her!    (S)

        There was a young fellow named Kimble
        Whose prick was exceedingly nimble
        But fragile and slender
        And dainty and tender
        So he kept it enclosed in a thimble!         (S)

        An organist, playing at York,
        Had a prick that could hold a small fork,
        And, between obligattos,
        He'd munch at tomatoes
        To keep up his strength while at work!       (S)

        As the she-wolf and lioness feel
        For their cubs, so the Knight for his steel.
        When looking at such
        Ask leave ere you touch
        Or instead of seeing, you'll feel.           (C)

        Be still when a Bard holds the hall.
        Join the dancing or stand by the wall.
        Don't boast of your might
        Till you learn how to fight
        Or after or ever at all.                     (C)

        There once was a girl with a torso
        Like Jessica Rabbit's but more so!
        Her only complaint
        Was because Ink and Paint
        Gave each of her tits its own floor show!    (K)
