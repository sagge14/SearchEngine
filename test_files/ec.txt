ELECTRIC CARNIVAL AT LOLLAPALOOZA

There's a traveling road show of digital marvels criss-crossing
the country this summer, and it's coming to a town near you.  The
Electric Carnival is a featured attraction at Lollapalooza '94's
Mind Field.  Lollapalooza is a concert tour founded in 1990 to
showcase the best in alternative rock.  For the past four years,
the festival has presented numerous prominent alternative bands,
a second stage of local bands, and a front-of-the-house area with
additional attractions.  Sponsored by Interval Research Corporation,
Electric Carnival will present Lollapalooza concert-goers with over
60 kiosks showing 18 different kinds of multimedia exhibits.  For
the final three weeks, the carnival will have a satellite Internet
connection.

Join the Carnival -- Volunteer!
Sound cool?  Then why not come be a member of the Electric Carnival
crew for a day?  We're looking for volunteer facilitators to help
us out at each Lollapalooza site.  Want to experience all the new
technology first hand?  Do you have an understanding of what
interactive multimedia really is?  Interested in sharing your
knowledge, as well as expanding on your expertise, with Lollapalooza
concert-goers who may have little or no understanding of the
Internet?

Here's the deal -- You'll get free admission to Lollapalooza in
exchange for working on the Electric Carnival crew for a 4-1/2 hour shift.

The job -- As a volunteer facilitator you'll have the chance to be
part of the Electric Carnival team in some of the following ways:
guide concert goers through the Internet and help people find the
coolest places to go; be part of a video crew and collect footage
from all over Lollapalooza; select snipets of the best video footage
to project on video screens; coordinate crowd movement in and out
of the tent; help people make their own animated or quicktime
movies; trouble shoot simple problems, demonstrate CD-ROMS,
demonstrate multimedia production tools; and assist them in using
some of the exhibits.

The skills -- desired, but not necessarily required -- solid
understanding of the Internet, and/or multimedia applications
(Macromedia Director, Adobe Photoshop, Premier, Painter, etc!);
background in theatre, experience with digital art, and a genuine
enthusiasm for multimedia technology and its potential for personal
expression.  You must be 16 or older.

THE FUTURE IS NOW!!!  The superhighway is here whether we like it
or not -- now the question is if we're going to stick out our thumbs
and hope someone stops to pick us up, or learn how to drive for
ourselves.
