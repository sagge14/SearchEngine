  For  more  than 100 years the Moroccan government has allowed (Ignored)  kif
  cultivation  near  the  pine-covered  crest  of  the  otherwise  barren  Rif
  Mountains,  in  a  limited area closely surrounding the village  of  Ketama.
  However,  the  industry has grown in the past 10 years and farms now  nearly
  cover all the upper mountain ranges and much lowland as far as 75 miles from
  the  once  quiet Ketama. Fifteen years ago less than 500 sqaure  miles  were
  under  hashish cultivation. Before hashish cultivation, kif cultivation used
  only  approximatly  500 sqware miles. Now, cultivation covers 10,000  square
  miles  and nearly every terraced field with a source of water is filled with
  kif  plants from spring to late summer. Hashish is the only major product of
  the  region  and  it is one of the only crops that will grow  here.  If  the
  incredible  tonnage of hashish produced and its comparatively high wholesale
  market  value  are  used  as indicators, it appears  that  hashish  must  be
  Morocco's number one export. 

  Most  of the kif is harvested in late July and early August when the weather
  turns  hottest  and  driest. The plants change from medium green  to  golden
  yellow  as they begin to wilt and die in the baking sun. Some plants in well
  irrigated  fields  remain  green longer and are  left  until  mid-September.
  Moroccan  farmers  don't wait for the resin to build up on the flowers  like
  sinsemilla  farmers  do. All of these plants are completely seeded.  Rather,
  the  Moroccan farmer decided to harvest when the plants run out of water and
  begin  to die. The longer the water holds out, the longer the plants have to
  mature,  and  the more potent the resins become and the taller  the  plants.
  Unfortunatly,  chemical fertilizers are now commonly and extensivly used  to
  increase  yield  on  exhausted land and absolutly every farmer  agrees  that
  chemical  fertilizers produce inferior taste, smell and high, and are not as
  sticky either. 

  Now  that  farmers are only growing for resin and are not growing the  whole
  plant  for  kif, the genetics are rapidly declining. Now,  unselected  seeds
  from  inferior  plants  are  what everone uses for planting.  Old  time  kif
  farmers  had  a close personal relationship with thier crops when they  were
  growing  for  flowers and not just for resin. The single stalks from one  to
  eight  feet  in lenght are bundled for transport to the home  compund  where
  they  are  laid on hot tin roofs to dry in the sun for about 5  days.  After
  they  are  fairly  crisp the bundles are stacked in  collected  for  hashish
  production.  Dry weight yield for plants is approximatly 10 grams per square
  foot, 100 grams per sqaure meter. 

  Resin  collection  is very simply performed by stretching a single layer  of
  nylon  scarf  material  across the mouth of a large plastic  wash  tub.  The
  entire  plants are covered with a sheet of plastic and flailed with a  stick
  over the tub. The large stems are thrown away and the crushed plant material
  is  rubbed  back and forth across the cloth sieve. The coarse  plant  debris
  stays  behind while the resin glands, powdered plant material, dust and dirt
  falls  through  the seieve and is collected in the wash tub. The harder  and
  longer  the plant material is rubbed on the screen, the more plant  material
  goes  through with the resin, This process is repeated over and over up to a
  dozen  times  until  nothing but powdered green leaf is coming  through  the
  sieve.  The  first  and  second  extractions  are  mostly  resin  while  the
  subsequent batches are mostly debris. 

  The  Moroccans  can  market almost any quality of hashish and  no  resin  is
  wasted  as  you shall see. The first two or three sievings are  combined  to
  produce  the best commercial grade of Moroccan hashish known as "Zero-Zero."
  the  yield  from 100 kilos of dried kif plants is approximatly 2 to 3  kilos
  (or  2,000  to 3,000 grams) of "Zero-Zero" quality hashish. This quality  is
  rarely  available  on the export market ans is usually the BEST quality  you
  will  be offered in Morocco. Although, with diligent hunting in the  farming
  area  it is possible to find higher quality (70 to 1000 grams from 100 kilos
  dry  plants),  but  only in small quantities of less than  100  grams.  Most
  exported  comercial quality is 5 to 10 kilos hashish from 100 kilos of dried
  plant. We wouldnt smoke it. 

  However, the vast majority of hashish exported from Morocco and found across
  Europe  is  manufactured from the lower grades of green leafy resin  powder.
  Binders  are  used to make the low grade powder sticky so it can be  pressed
  together  to look like real nice dark hashish. These sorts of practices  are
  also  carried  out  in  the Afghan-Pakistani border  region,  another  major
  supplier  of  hashish to Europe. Binders include butter, bananas, pine  tar,
  plant  gums,  sweetened condensed milk, henna, motor oil, and worst of  all,
  paraffin wax. Up to 10% of the weight of commercial hashish can be accounted
  for  by  binders such as wax. Wax helps poor quality resins  stick  together
  like good resin would, and when a match is put to it, will keep a flame like
  superior  hashish  would. Who knows what smoking petrolum wax does  to  your
  lungs,  but  it can't be good for you! The idea behind making hashish is  to
  get a stronger, cleaner smoke so you consume less impurities, and smoke less
  in  total,  than  by using crude Marijuana. Adding adulterants  defeats  the
  purpose, decieves the public, and endangers health. 

  A  fairly high grade of hashish can be produced from seedy Morrocan kif, but
  only  by  rigorusly performing the proper techniques as first taught to  the
  Moroccans  by  Mustafa the Algerian. First selected superior plants must  be
  cleaned of all leaf to remove any potential impurities. The leaves dont have
  any resin on them anyways and are covered with dust. Then while working over
  the  sieve  the  flowering tops are carefully stripped then  the  stems  are
  crushed  without reducing the to powder. The resin heads are shaken  through
  the  cloth by slapping the sides of the plastic tub, but the cloth is  never
  touched nor the flowers rubbed across it. After shaking, the crushed flowers
  are  dumped to the side not brushed off by hand which pushed debris  through
  the  screen. These crushed flowers are saved for later comercial  extraction
  and  another portion of flowers is gingerly crushed over the sieve. Only the
  resin glands and fine dust flass through the cloth and is collected from the
  bottom  of  the tub. This already potent can be further cleaned  by  lightly
  rubbing  it  across  the  top  of a double layer  or  slightly  finer  scarf
  material.  This allows most of the fine dirt and dust to fall though but few
  of  the  coarser  resin heads. The resin remaining on top of  the  sieve  is
  nearly pure cannabis resin free of most of the dirt and plant debris. 

  Pure  hashish  as it was originally intended to be prepared, is easily  hard
  pressed into what the Moroccans call chewing gum. Before resin glands can be
  smoked  the  must  be  pressed into a piece of hashish.  The  Moroccans  use
  hydraulic  jacks to press 250 grams comercial pieces. "Zero-Zero" powder  is
  simply  poured  into a cellophane bag and lightly squeezed with  the  press,
  since  it  is  naturally  sticky enough to stay together.  This  produces  a
  yellowish  blonde  slab.  The  very best pieces can  be  hand  pressed  with
  difficulty.  The resins are very dry from baking in the sun so they are  not
  as  easily to press as higher grade shade-dried resins. Lower grade  powders
  are  mixed with adulterants and binders, heated, and hammer beaten to  blend
  the  ingredients  thoroughly before they are squeezed into molds under  high
  pressure.  A  dark  reddish  to deep brown slab of Modern  Morrocan  is  the
  result, ready for export. 

  Most  smokers  assume  what  they are smoking is  clean  hashish  free  from
  impurities.  In  fact  most of it is tainted. The hashish  manufactures  are
  crafty  and it is difficult for the average smoker to detect adulterants  in
  hashish. Kif mixed with tobacco is smoked one hit at a time in a long wooden
  -stemmed sibsi pipe with a small red clay bowl. Hashish is smoked in the sam
  fashion.  However, we rolled thumb diameter joints with three to five  grams
  of  the best (Personally made "Zero-Zero-Zero-Zero") on a cardboard  filter.
  This  allowed  much faster consumption and provided the rushes  we  traveled
  thousands of miles to enjoy. 

  While  commerical techniques yield more than 3,00 grams of mediocre  hashish
  per  100 kilos of kif, traditional hashish techniques yeild only 100 to  200
  grams  of super clean and pure hashish. Because it is twice as good as their
  best, we call it "Zero-Zero-Zero-Zero." as an experiment we had 100 kilos of
  whole,  dried  Moroccan  plants completely maicured and cleaned  to  various
  components.  The breakdown was: 15 kilos leaf 20 kilos stem 50 kilos seed 15
  kilos  flower  In  morocco, 100 kilos dried plants is really only  15  kilos
  flowers  and  farmers  extract up to 5 to 10 kilos of  so-called  resin.  No
  wonder  the resin needs help to stick together! American improved  varieties
  such  as Skunk #1 can yield up to 70 kilos of pure flowers from 100 kilos of
  dried  plant.  There  is much more resin and the resins  can  be  sinsemilla
  resins  with  little  dirt or dust. That's five to ten times the  weight  in
  resin! 

  The  older  farmers remember how to make fine hashish but they cannot get  a
  high  enough  price  for it to make it worthwhile to produce. It  just  isnt
  worth  the  twenty to thirty times the price to enough connoisseur  smokers.
  The  moroccans  make much more money by selling lesser quality product.  The
  only  answer to this dilemma is to make your own hashish. Most smokers can't
  take  the  time  to  travel  to the third world  in  search  of  inexpensive
  marijuana  as a source for thier own pieces of hashish. However, along  with
  the  burgeoning marijuana cultivating industry comes a ready supply of  high
  -grade  domestically  grown cannabis with resin suitble for making  hashish.
  Outdoor  plants,  greenhousr plants, and artifical light plants can  all  be
  utilized to make high grade hashish. 

  Ending Note: 

  Place  silscreen under your work area while you manicure, package, and  roll
  doobies.  A  piece  of black plexiglass or a mirror under the  screen  makes
  collecting the separated resins easy with a credit card. Correct screen size
  is  43 threads to the centimeter, 100-120 to the inch, for most domestically
  grown resin heads. Moroccan because of smaller resin heads requires 60-80 to
  the  centimeter, 150-200 to the inch. Also, Zero-Zero orginally got its name
  from the hole size of the silk fabric that was the finest, "00."

  If you actually get a hold of some fine hash, 
  why dont you give these systems a ring, Its a trip...
