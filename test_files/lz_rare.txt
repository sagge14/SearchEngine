		50 rarest Led Zeppelin and related records
			by Robert Godwin



Trying to determine the 50 rarest albums by Led Zeppelin is somewhat
like trying to determine the 50 rarest coins - it's a matter of opinion.
Not only that, new ones are always turning up. The following list is
based primarily on the recording's scarcity, and does not include
bootleg recordings.

At this writing, the rarest official Led Zeppelin release is the
original Japanese Atlantic/Polydor pressing of "Immigrant Song" backed
with "Out On The Tiles." The only official single to feature both songs,
this disk is valued at $2000 by collectors. Runner-up on the list is
"She Just Satisfies", a solo single recorded by Page and drummer Bobbie
Graham for the Fontana label in 1965, which has been known to be worth
as much as $700.

The third most sought-after Zeppelin release is "Communication
Breakdown"/"Good Times Bad Times," a promo-only item with an interesting
history. In 1969 Atlantic tried to pressure Zeppelin into releasing a UK
single, but the band resisted because they did not approve of the
'commercial implications.' As a result, the record was pressed but did
not get past the promotional stage. Copies of this sell steadily for
$200.

Next is a curiosity from the African nation, Angola. Two things
contribute to the rarity of this piece: it was pressed just prior to a
major political upheaval (which still continues), and it is the only
Zeppelin piece to be licensed in such an obscure (in rock and roll
terms) land. It comes with a very attractive picture sleeve and is
extremely hard to find.

Prior to the release of Led Zeppelin I in 1969, white label test
pressings were distributed quite extensively by Atlantic to college and
FM radio stations. The labels of these promos say "Test Pressing", and
feature the typed words, "Led Zeppelin." If you can find one, expect to
pay as much as $200. Atlantic, still pushing for a British single
release, pressed a mid-1969 promo of "Whole Lotta Love"/"Living Loving
Maid." The band again foiled the company's intentions, and as a result
these rare promos now sell for over $150.

Back in 1968, Atlantic's U.S. division disseminated promo
seven-inch copies of "Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"/"Dazed And Confused."
This came in an attractive picture sleeve depicting the Hindenburg
crash. This very hard-to-find release today commands as much as $150. In
1972 Atlantic tried yet again for a U.K. single, this time with the
approval of Robert Plant. However, Plant could not convince the rest of
the band and we are once more left with a promo-only of "D'yer
Mak'er"/"Over The Hills And Far Away." Collectors should note that this
is the only record available with these two songs back to back.

Another facet of Atlantic's massive push for Zeppelin in 1969
included an in-store promotional album featuring Page and company on one
side and Dusty Springfield on the other! Slipcased in a black and white
cover, the album includes songs from the first album that are
periodically interrupted by some unintentionally hilarious voice-overs
encouraging the prospective consumer to "fly higher with Led Zeppelin."
This remnant of stranger, if more innocent, days currently sells for
approximately $150.

And speaking of stranger days, we now take a leap back to the
summer of 1966, when Robert Plant was still struggling in his native
Birmingham with a band named Listen. Listen signed with CBS and recorded
a single that is now valued at $120. Very few were sold - it seems no
one was listening - and most extant copies are promos or DJ releases.
Plant then recorded two other failed singles as a solo artist. There is
some evidence that CBS was trying to groom Robert to be the next Pat
Boone, and it is even suspected that his vocal tracks were slowed down
in order to make his croon more convincing. These bizarre artifacts no
sell for about $120 apiece.

Another quirky early solo release is John Paul Jones's 1964
debut with Pye Records. "A Foggy Day In Vietnam"/"Baja" was also
released in the US by Parkway. Both versions are valued at roughly $100.
The US version is dated "1962" on the label; the error is not explained.

In the early Seventies, SR International licensed LZ II from
Atlantic for distribution through the RCA record club. This resulted in
a variation on the traditional "Brown Bomber" jacket. Pressed in
Austria, this very handsome piece is now valued between $100 and $150.
Similarly priced is the original Japanese pressing by Nippon Grammophon
of Led Zeppelin I, which features a gatefold cover. Another jacket
variation to watch out for (and there aren't very many) is the "German
double", which combined the first two albums in a beautiful gatefold
jacket. This was released without the knowledge or consent of the band
and was almost immediately withdrawn - $120 to $150 will probably cover
this one. Rumor has it that there is Yugoslavian version; if you find
yourself in Ljublyana of Zagreb, buy it!

BBC's broadcast of Zep at the Paris Theater in 1971 has been
bootlegged beyond belief, but the original BBC transcription disks are
extremely hard to find. Prices vary enormously on this release, but do
not expect to pay any less than $100 for a single album. The Westwood
One radio network has re-broadcast most of the BBC shows a number of
times. These Westwood pressings usually sell for $100 to $150 for the
complete two-album set. A four-song promo for Houses Of The Holy was
pressed for the US Armed Forces Network; again, expect to pay $100.

"Stairway To Heaven" probably would have sold quite well as a single,
but it was never released. However, in a ploy to get the maximum amount
of airplay, Atlantic pressed seven-inch promo of the song with a picture
sleeve. $100 will probably get you one of these in mint condition.

Overseas seven-inch pressings are many and varied, but two of the rarest
are the Spanish picture sleeve promos from Houses Of The Holy. The
sleeves are entirely different from the commercial releases and are
worth approximately $80 apiece. Another overseas gem is a Brazilian
promo EP that was included in special issues of Rock Espetacular
magazine. The EP features the blues epic "Since I've Been Loving You,"
along with "Friends" and "Celebration Day." This is the only 7" with
these three songs and is valued at $65. Eastern bloc pressings were very
limited; one of the rarest is the Yugoslavian seven-inch of "D'yer
Mak'er," accompanied by a nice picture sleeve. This is worth about $60.

All 10 of Zeppelin's albums were available as white-label promos, with
the most valuable being LZ I, which commands from $50 to $100. Also be
on the watch for the mono white label version of Houses Of The Holy.

Some of the rarest releases come from Japan. Several late-Sixties Nippon
Grammophon-pressed singles are now valued at $60. A US promo for
"Gallow's Pole" can be had for about the same money.

Moving back to 1968, the Yardbirds released and then promptly withdrew a
single featuring Jimmy Page, entitled "Goodnight Sweet Josephine."
Although the song is really quite poor, it is a shame that the B-side
was not given more of a chance. "Think About It" includes some of Page's
best work with the band and hints at things to come. If you are lucky
enough to find a copy, be prepared to pay $60. If not, buy the British
edition of the Yardbird's Little Games, which includes six tracks with
Page that do not appear on the US original.

P.J. Proby's album, Three Week Hero (Liberty), was the first commercial
release featuring all four members of Led Zeppelin (Plant plays
harmonica). Worth approximately $50, this UK-only record is still sought
after by Proby collectors and Zep fans alike.

Another valuable promo is an Atlantic-licensed EP with picture sleeves
designed for jukeboxes. These occasionally turn up for $30, but can cost
as much $60.

An Australian pressing of Led Zeppelin II that featured a picture of the
band inside the gatefold, instead of the traditional blimp in
floodlights, was quickly withdrawn. It now commands $50. Another classic
piece that was also withdrawn is Live Yardbirds Featuring Jimmy Page.
Released by Epic in 1971 to cash in on Zeppelin's growing popularity,
the album featured poorly produced recordings of the band in action at
the Anderson Theater in NY. Jimmy Page, who owned the rights to the
Yardbirds' name, served an injunction against Epic demanding immediate
withdrawal of the offending piece. Although Page maintains that the
band's performance is inferior, this album is highly recommended. His
playing is forceful, and the early version of "Dazed And Confused" is
historic. Counterfeits sell for approximately $40, but it is well-worth
investing the extra $20 or so to get an original.

Some EP variations from Mexico are available periodically for about $25
to $35; these usually come in handsome picture sleeves. Also look for
similar items from Taiwan. There are several variations of the fourth
album, but one of the most sought-after is the pink vinyl edition
released in the UK.

Ten standard singles were released in Europe, but there were a few
interesting variations. "Bron-Y-Aur Stomp"/"Out On The Tiles" from
Holland is not available anywhere else, and two pieces from Italy -
"Heartbreaker"/"Bring It On Home" and "Bron-Y-Aur Stomp"/"Immigrant
Song" - are also unique. All three are valued at $20 to $40. Another
unique Italian promo piece pairs the live version of "Rock And Roll"
from TSRTS with a disco track by the Trammps. This was intended for
jukeboxes only.

Five thousand copied of "Trampled Underfoot"/"Black Country Woman" were
pressed and given away in a printed sleeve to store owners who bought
inventory of Zep's albums. These are still quite elusive and are valued
at $20. The 10 most common singles were made available in New Zealand in
the mid-Eighties in a boxed set. Each disk came in a blue WEA dust
sleeve and the pressings were of superior quality. One odd aspect of the
set is that some of the A- and B-sides are reversed, presumably by
accident. Due to its size and scarcity, the set now sells for about
$100.

Our list cocludes with two cover variations. In Uruguay, where most of
Zep's albums were released, an extremely strange promo copy of ITTOD was
pressed. It has a picture of the band on the cover, which suggests that
it could be a pirate. The other is definitely not a pirate. A UK version
of LZ I that features the name of the band and the Atlantic logo in blue
lettering instead of orange now fethces $20.

There are, no doubt, worlds of Zep oddities waiting to be discovered and
suitably price-tagged. Meanwhile, the foregoing should supply
Zeppophiles with plenty of drool for thought.
