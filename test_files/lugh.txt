Here's something I wrote a wile back for Keltria:

The Coming of Lugh
    by Iarwain

Lugh the Il-Dana came to the Tara
Lugh Samildanach came to the palace of the Tutha De
Lugh, master of all arts, came to Eireann

The gate keeper did not recognize Lugh
The gate keeper asked the Il-Dana his name
The gate keeper asked Lugh Samildanach what skill he possesed

Lugh said:

I am Lugh Samildanach
I am Lugh the Il-Dana
I am Lugh, master of battle

The gate keeper said:

We have no need of a battle master
King Nuada de Danann is our battle master
Nuada Airgitlamh is our battle master

Lugh said:

Lugh said:

The gate keeper said:

Oghma is master of all knowledge

Lugh said:

The gate keeper said:

Mananan mac Lyr, son of the sea, is our master of sailing

Lugh said:

I am Lugh Samildanach
I am Lugh the Il-Dana
I am Lugh, master of sorcery

The gate keeper said:

We have no need of a master of sorcery
The Badb de Danann are mistresses of all sorcery
The three sisters Macha, Nemhain and 
    Morrigan are mistresses of all witchcraft

Lugh said:

I am Lugh Samildanach
I am Lugh the Il-Dana
I am Lugh, master of smithing

The gate keeper said:

We have no need of a master of smithing

Lugh said:

I am Lugh Samildanach
I am Lugh the Il-Dana
I am Lugh, master of the battle
I am Lugh, master of healing
I am Lugh, master of knowledge
I am Lugh, master of sailing
I am Lugh, master of sorcery
I am Lugh, master of smithing

I bid you, unless you know of another who is master
of all these arts, take me to Nuada Airgitlamh,
take me to Nuada, king of the Tutha de Danann.

The gatekeeper went to Nuada.
When Nuada heard of Lugh's coming he said:
Let him come in, for never has his like entered
this fortress

Lugh the Il-Dana was admitted to the Tara
Lugh Samildanach was admitted to the palace of the Tuatha De
Lugh master of all arts found his place amongst the Tuatha de Denann
