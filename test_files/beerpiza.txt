What's a BEER without a PIZZA!

BEER DRINKER'S DEEP-PAN PIZZA

Ingredients:

Crust: 1 cup warm BEER (110 to 120 degrees F)
       4 tablespoons olive or salad oil
       1 tablespoon sugar
       1.5 teaspoons salt
       1 package active dry yeast
       2.25 to 3.25 cups all-purpose flour
       2 tablespoons cornmeal

Topping: 10 to 12 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded or
         thinly sliced
         1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste
         .5 cup BEER
         2 teaspoons oregano
         1 teaspoon fennel seed (optional)
         .5 teaspoon sugar
         .5 to 1 pound bulk pork or Italian sausage,
         broken up
         .5 cup grated Parmesan cheese

1. For crust, combine in a large bowl the warm beer, 2
tablespoons oil, sugar, salt, and yeast.  Add 1.5 cups flout;
beat until smooth.  Stir in enough additional flour to make a
fairly stiff dough.
2. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead
until smooth and elastic (about 5 minutes).  Place dough in a
greased bowl, turning once to grease top.  Cover and let rise
in warm place(85 degrees F) until double in bulk (about 1
hour).
3. Punch down dough.(For 2 small pizzas, divide in half.)
Using 2 tablespoons oil, coat a 14-inch round deep pizza pan.
(Or use two 9-inch round cake pans.)  Sprinkle with cornmeal.
Pat dough into pan,  Pinching up a rim around the edge.
Cover and let rise in a warm place until double in bulk
(about 30 minutes.
4. For topping, mix tomato paste, beer, oregano, fennel seed,
and sugar.  Cover pizza dough evenly with mozzarella cheese;
evenly spoon on tomato paste mixture.  Sprinkle with sausage,
then top with Parmesan cheese.
5. Bake at 450 degrees F 15 to 20 minutes, or until crust is
browned and sausage is cooked
ONE LARGE OR 2 SMALL PIZZAS; 4 SERVINGS

Note:  Alternate toppings could be (1) 1 can (4 ounces)
sliced mushrooms, drained, or (2) 8 anchovies plus .33 cup
chopped ripe olives, or (3) .5 pound sliced pepperoni.  Omit
or reduce the sausage, but include cheeses and tomato sauce.
