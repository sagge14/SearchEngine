 Dumb as dirt and twice as mean, such a son makes mother crazy 
 Foul as sewers I have seen, ugly, loutish, large and lazy 
 That's the child I've had to raise, what's a Mom to do? 
 Drag him to our ocean cave, and stay to watch him too. 
    
   Son of mine, you've been a disappointment since your birth 
   Now I've got to bury you in this cold northern earth 
   I know you would be sorry if you weren't so very dead 
   But you never listened to a word I said. 
 
 Everybody's got to rest, even I get tired and sleepy 
 Sonny left our little nest on errands cruel and creepy 
 Came back with a haunch of Man gnawed down to the bone 
 Left each night from that day on, while I slept like a stone 
 
 Vikings gathered in their hall, heroes all in war delighting 
 When my Grendel came to call he was met with mighty fighting 
 One among them took his arm, ripped it off for good 
 Chased him to our ocean home and killed him where he stood 
 
 When I found my wine was spiked, it was far too late to aid him 
 Though there wasn't much I liked, I was often glad I'd made him 
 So I must avenge him now, what's a Mom to do? 
 If he was yours anyhow, I bet that you would too

 Backhand blows and trust betrayed, teach a son to love his mother 
 Cursed be he and she that made, less a man than something other 
 Hellbent have I been since birth, damned for father's sin 
 Hating all I stalk this earth, leave havoc where I've been 
 
      Mother, dear, I know I disappoint you, I don't care 
      All I have to thank you for are long years of despair 
      You tell me that you love me now that my poor life is done 
      but I don't believe you'll miss me when I'm gone 
 
 Mother snores while Grendel creeps out for sport and bellyfilling 
 Hunting rabbits in their sleeps, such as they were made for killing 
 I the one to teach them fear, I the one to slay 
 Satan's laughter echoes near when Grendel goes to play 
 
 "Save us, dear Lord, from this Beast," the Danes cried out, a hero came 
 I went to join them in their feast and learned the bitter taste of shame 
 I howled to shatter Heaven's walls, shrieked so Hell could hear 
 Told all creation with my calls my mortal end was near 
 
 Now at last my breath is gone, Mother, it's too late to chasten 
 Let me lie till death comes on, then away to Hell I'll hasten 
 Heaven's road is hidden from the likes of you or me 
 I'll go when I'm bidden "come", but I will wait for thee...
