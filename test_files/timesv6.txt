             THE POT GUIDE
             --- --- -----

  Note from the Authors:

       We have never smoked marijuana,
   and never will.  But our friend, 
   Ernie Lundquist, has.  He told us 
   all the stuff that's in this file.

       P.S. Ernie lives at 2120 North
   Highland Avenue, Apartment B, Los 
   Angeles, California 90028.  He 
   keeps his stash in his shower 
   curtain rod.  Now, that the file is
   finished, we don't need him anymore.

        THE EFFECTS OF GRASS
        --- ------- -- -----

   Here are two "profound" revelations
 revealed to our friend Ernie while he
 was stoned: "Survival of the species
 is everybody's business," And "No
 matter how much you dislike pickles,
 it is, after all, the only thing that
 you can do with cucumbers."

  Sample Stoned Conversation
  ------ ------ ------------

 VIRGINIA: Are you hungry?
 ANDY: No. (Long reflective pause.) 
       Wait a minute. Did you mean am
       I hungry for food, or am I
       hungry in the abstract, like 
       hungry for knowledge or 
       adventure?
 VIRGINIA: What are you talking about?
 ANDY: You asked if I were hungry.
 VIRGINIA: Did I?
 ANDY: Yes.
 VIRGINIA: Well, are you?
 ANDY: Am I what?
                                          Hiding Places
  ------ ------

 The Hollow Chairleg- This is not a
     good place.  The chair will break
     when a cop is over asking about
     the man who used to live next
     door.

 Putting the grass in a small jar and
 putting that jar in a large jar of
 mayonaise- This is O.K. but you get
     mayonaise on your hands, and in
     your hair and everything.

 Throwing it way up high- Excellent,
     for very short periods of time.


  Dangers of Grass
  ------- -- -----

  1) Getting Busted

--------------------------------------
  You have smoked your first marajuana
 cigarette.  It's your bedroom or
 living room alright, and everything
 is exactly the same, but everything
 is exactly different than it ever was
 before you were stoned.  And suddenly
 you don't care about your arthritis,
 or that you have to appear in court
 that next day because of a speeding
 ticket, or that you've got a mid-term
 paper due in two days, or that you've
 only got one ear.
