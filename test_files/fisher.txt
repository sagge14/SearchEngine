Fisher's Chant
Leslie Fish
--------------

 Chorus:
   Come up, come up, oh sweet thresher shark
   One of us today will die
   One will go down the other one's throat
   Beneath the pitiless sky.

The earth is thick with the numbers of men
The poisoned soil grows cold
So out we go to the ancient seas
To fish as we did of old.

   (Chorus)

The gods made man like any other beast
For all that his pride denies
So he must take his turn at the kill
And all of the rest is lies.

  (Chorus)

And you who raise tame beasts on the land
That you march to the slaughterhouse door
Can point no safe fat finger at us
Who risk a little bit more.

  (Chorus)

And you who buy your meat at the store
Can raise no cry of shame
For as you pay for the food-beasts death
You eat, so you share the blame.

  (Chorus)

And you who feed on nothing but plants
Don't hold your pride so high
For plants are living, and just might feel
And they take so long to die.

  (Chorus)
So come to the battle of the jaws and gaff
At the meeting of sea and air
We'll duel for food while the old gods laugh...
By the gods, this fight is fair!

  Come up, come up, oh sweet thresher shark
  One of us today will die
  One will go down the other one's throat
  Beneath the pitiless sky, oh
  Beneath the pitiless sky.
