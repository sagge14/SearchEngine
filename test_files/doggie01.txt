                       COME HOME, LITTLE DOGGIE
                              By Lucillus
                          Dedicated to Dog
                (Sung to the tune of "Autumn to May")

Oh, once I knew a little dog, 
   As scrawny as could be
He got so drunk that late one night
  He joined poor Anglesea.
And every day we hear the yell:
 "Swordbrother, come to me!"
Now where, oh, where, has doggie gone?
Where could that deadbeat be?

    Yell, Hendrick, yell!
   Call your doggie home!

Well, once we lost him in the straw
    In KinderFodder camp
They would not let us leave that night
Said: "Don't forget that scamp.
The one you buried in the straw
 And hoped we would not see
For we have problems of our own
 We don't need Anglesea's."

     Hide, doggie, hide!
   Drag your carcass home!

But worst of all he does corrupt
    So many younger boys
A thirteen year old got drunk one night
And Finn said: "What's that noise?
You stupid Dog! What have you done?
 Go take him home right now!
For if he stays we will get blamed
 And I will tell them how!"

      Run, Doggie, run!
  Take that poor boy home!


                                And late one night he was convinced
                                     The trees were closing in
                                He grabbed poor Ursus by the shirt
                                     And went along with him.
                             He begged: "Please don't leave me alone!
                                     Stay with me all night!"
                                 The minute Ursus turned his head
                                     Dog was gone from sight.

                                        Hide, Doggie, Hide!
                                     I hope the trees get you!

                               You know that Doggie thinks that he 
                                      Is liked by one and all
                               He'll say just what you want to hear
                                   And come at right your call.
                               Unless, of course, his kinsman shouts
                                   Then he's nowhere to be found
                               And soon as Hendrick leaves the camp
                                    You'll soon see him around.

                                         Why, Doggie, why?
                                      Can't you stay at home?
