        Please read the section below regarding the formatting of entries 
        you might send to this list to be included.  I will NO LONGER 
        accept mis-formatted entries.  Too much work.

         The Great Usenet Just-Say-NO-to-PISS-TESTs Project
This is the Great Usenet Piss Test Registry Project Monthly Posting.

You will find two lists in this postings.  The first is a list
of companies that have PISS or other Human Quality test
programs as reported by first person experience.  The second
list is a list of companies that are known to have public
policies AGAINST the invasion of privacy and the violation of
Constitutional Protection that Human Quality tests constitute. 

If you have FIRST PERSON experience (no rumors) with a company not on these 
lists, please send a note, in the format of a record in the
tables below, to the following address:

        piss@dixie.com  <<<--- preferred, mailers like this domain
        piss@rsiatl.uucp  (old method)
        emory!dixie.com!piss
        uunet!dixie.com!piss

Your identity will be protected and all identifying data will be 
deleted from DIXIE as soon as the list is updated.  I will attempt to 
acknowledge your message but with mailers being what they are, if you 
don't get an acknowledge, please send a duplicate.

***** Please NOTE:

    If you send information on a company, please try to fill in all fields
    in my form.  Particularly the "recourse" field.  Many people are 
    forced to choose between the lesser of 2 evils and knowing what
    the company does beyond forcing the piss act is important.

If you would like to obtain a copy of this list at intervals other than
the first of the month, an automatic server will ship you a copy.  Simply
send mail to the above addresses and set the Subject: line to "send".
Any text in the message body is dropped.
Example:

Subject:  Send list

The list will be returned to you via your From: address.

Tests other than Piss tests should also be reported to this list.  For
example, if your company has a mandatory medical test and requires the
right to release the results to insurance companies or others, you should
send a note. (I'm sorry, Mr. Smith.  Your life insurance policy has been
disapproved.  Your company medical test showed too much chlorestrol and
too high blood pressure.)

                  **** Statement of Purpose ****

This list exists as a one man crusade (supported by a cast of thousands)
against the current Government sponsored terrorism sometimes called 
the Drug War, and the resultant destruction of the Constitution.  This crusade 
is about Constitutional protections, individual privacy and freedom.  It 
is NOT an advocacy of the abuse of any mind-altering substance.  It is a
strong plea to consider the data contained herein when making purchasing
or employment decisions.

Note:  I try to keep this list with the columns aligned with spaces
        Occasionally, however, tabs creep in.  This list is formatted with
        tabstops set to 4.  To properly view the list in vi, execute the 
        command :set tabstop=4.  To properly print this file, route it 
        through pr(1) with the command line pr -e4 -o4 piss.list |lp
        for Sys V.  For BSD or other systems, you're on your own :-)

Comment Legend:

1.  There is no testing of any kind and the company has made a public 
    policy statement against any such testing.

2.  There is no testing but the company has not made a policy statement
    public and/or has no policy.

Notes:

[1] CEO is Ryal Poppa and is reported to be on personal crusade.
    Address:
        2770 So. 88th St.
        Louisville, CO, 80027

[2] Dearborn, Mi

[3] Georgia Tech Research Institute, the commercial research branch
    of Georgia Tech.

[4] The testing company will re-test *the same sample* on a positive result;
    if the re-test is positive the candidate is not hired.  There is *no* retest
    from a different sample.

[5] Lynchburg, VA.  The personnel director is: Larry Langhans

[6] Texas Instruments, Lewisville, TX plant, fairly certain that all other
    Texas plants are also doing it (especially Dallas).

[7] tests for: cocaine, amphetamines, pcp, marijuana. only tests for
    5-8 substances. If the first test is positive, the sample is
    subjected to a more detailed test.  If both tests are positive,
    a medical review officer contacts the employee and asks about
    medication; the employee has an opportunity to have medical
    review officer call every one of his/her doctors. If medical
    review officer determines that no legal substance caused a
    positive test, employee's supervisor and management chain are
    ntoified. Employee can be sent to mandatory drug counseling and
    follow-up testing, or fired. On any following positive test,
    employee will be fired unless department head intervenes. There
    is a wider range of disciplinary actions than indicated here.

[8] contract house: they ask if you will take the test
    on the application form.  I was told that most
    clients who do not test wish only contract help
    that is willing to be tested (like requiring the 
    test without performing it).
[9] Must sign a waiver giving company rights to use results of test in any
    way they wish.  (I assume this includes sharing the results with other
    possible employers and/or Insurance Company Data Banks.)

[10]Only applicable to `inside' contractors and regular employees.  Testing
    not required for `outside' contractors.

[11]Topaz is a subsidiary of Square D corp.

[12] CostCo is a wholesale consumer goods store that has signs outside
     proudly proclaiming that they abuse their employees with piss tests.

[13] Each business unit in AT&T sets its own policies.  Bell Labs and
     certain other units do NOT test.

[14] Corporate medical director keeps copies of ALL test results.

[15] Reliable Rumor has it that SCO is quite a party company!

[16] This company has a drug-free environment statement on file but 
     does not test.

[17] they run a check on your dmv and if you have failure to appears
         dui, etc. they don't hire you.

[18] Company has an official drug-free workplace statement which prohibits
    posession or use of illegal drugs on company premises, and prohibits
    reporting for work while under the influence of any illegal drug or
    alcohol.  No attempt is made to prescribe employees' activities during
    their off hours.

[19] It was asked why they hadn't published their "drug-free
    workplace" policy in their help-wanted ad, like other companies.
    The answer: US Windpower doesn't want to foster an image as 
        a "conservative company."

[20] Psych. Profile testing is not required for individual contributors.  
    However, a satisfactory Psych. Profile Test is a prerequisite for entry 
    into management.

[21] Hewlett-Packard's pre-employment drug testing plans are indefinitely
    "on hold".  That is, we're not doing drug testing now, and we have no
    definite date when it will be implemented in the future.  
        [recd 01/11/92 JGD]

[22] Brooktree is a company that DOES NOT do Human Quality Testing.
    In fact, every employee is given a plaque with the "Brooktree Values":

    value #6 reads:  "Brooktree believes everyone - including employees,
                  customers, shareholders, and suppliers - should be
                  treated with mutual trust, honesty and respect."

    Value #7 reads:  "Bureaucracy is counter-productive to the efficiency
                  of a rapidly growing company.  Systems are created to
                  to facilitate, not complicate, the smooth operation of
                  the business."

    Value #10 reads: "We believe informality promotes goodwill and leads
                  to a creative and productive environment.  Brooktree's
                  operating style is characterized by informal meetings,
                  open doors, frequent on-site social gatherings,
                  comfortable dress, and use of first names."

        Brooktree has on-site monthly parties with beer, wine and live bands.
        Beer and wine are also served at "all-employees meetings".

[23] Testing is performed before offer is given (ie. offer is contingent
        upon successful completion of the tests).  Unsure as to what recourse is
        taken if tests are not completed, but it would appear that no consent
        to testing would prevent an offer of employment from being made.
