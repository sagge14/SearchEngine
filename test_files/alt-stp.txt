Dead And Bloated
----------------
I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me on 
my birthday deathbed
I am smellin' like the rose
that somebody gave me
'cause I'm dead and bloated

Yeah, and she says it's
natural
I fell I've come of age
When she peeks I start to run

You can't swallow what I'm
thinkin'
You can't swallow what I'm
thinkin'

I run through the world 
thinkin' 'bout tommarow

I am trampled under sole of
another man's shoes
Guess I walked too softly

Oh yeah, and she says it's
natural
I feel I've come of age
When she peeks I start to run

You can't swallow what I'm
thinkin'
You can't swallow what I'm 
thinkin'


Ses Type Thing
--------------
I am, I am, I am
I said I wanna get next to you
I said I wanna get close to you
Youu wouldn't want me have to 
hurt you too?

I ain't, I ain't, I ain't
A buyin' into your apathy
I'm gonna learn ya my philosophy
You wanna know about atrocity?

I know you want what's on my 
mind
I know you like what's on my
mind
I know it eats you up inside
I know, you know, you know

I am a man, a man
I'll give ya somethin' that ya won't
forget
I said ya shouldn't have worn that 
dress
I said ya shouldn't have worn that 
dress

Here I come, I come, I come

Wicked Garden
-------------
Can you feel like a child?
Can you see what I want?
I wanna run through your
wicked garden
Heard that's the place to find
ya
But I'm alive
So alive now
I know the darkness blinds
you

Can you see without eyes?
Can you speak without lies?
I wanna drink from your naked
fountain
I can drown in sarrows
I'm gonna burn
Burn you to life now
Out of the dark that blinds you

Burn, burn, burn
Burn your wicked garden
down

Can you feel pain inside?
can you love?
Can you cry?
I wanna run through your 
wicked garden
Hear that's the place to find you


But I'm alive
So alive now
Out of the dark that blinds you


Sin
---
Holywater clouds my thinking
Sinking low now
Keep on drinking

Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin makes me
strong

You control me, soul you stole, 
mine
Wishful thinking
Six feet under

Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make
me strong

Dead by dreaming, sleep you
steal, mine
Pools of cold sweat
Hatred burns me

Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me
strong

Holywater clouds my thinking
Sinking low now
Keep on drinking

Feel what werein my eyes
Sink into the holes in my eyes
My sins have made me blind
Sink into the holes in my eyes

Still shackled to the shadow
Still shackled to the shadow
That followed you...


Naked Sunday
------------
You're the fuel to the fire
You're the weapons of war
You're the irony of justice
And the father of law


I've been waiting for awhile to
meet you
For the chance to shake your
hand
To give you thanks for all the 
suffering you command
And when all is over and we
return to dust
Who will be my judge and which
one do I trust?

Angst...

You're the champion of sarrow
You're the love and the pain
You're the fighter of evil
Yet you're the one and the same

Been waiting awhile to meet you
For the chance to shake your 
hand
To give you thanks for all the
suffering you command
And when all is over and we
return to dust
Who will be my judge and which
one do i trust?

Angst...

Creep
-----
Forward yesterday
Makes me wanna stay
What they said was real
Makes me wanna steal
Livin' under house
Guess I'm livin', I'm a mouse
All's I gots is time
Got no meaning, just a rhyme

Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal

I'm half the man I used to be
This feeling as the dawn
It turns to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
This feeling as the dawn
It turns to gray

Feelin' uninspired
Think I'll start a fire
Everybody run
Bobby's got a gun
Think you're kinda neat
Then she tells me I'm a creep
Friends don't mean a thing
Guess I'll leave it up to me


Piece of Pie
------------
I broke the breadline
Nobody knows
I walked the frontline
Still got far to go

I mixed the water
I drank the water

I broke the breadline
Don't wanna know

It's staring me down
Wearing a crown of apathy
I'm standing around
Dressed like a clown
Don't know my name
You know where to find me

I killed the manchild
I'll fast alone
I had the midwife
Naked and alone

I mixed the water
I drank the water

I killed the brainchild
I'll fast alone

Don't wanna let me be a man
Don't wanna lead me to your 
home


Plush
-----
And I feel that time's a wasted 
go
So where you going to tommarow?
And I feel that these are lies to
come
Would you even care?


And I feel it
And I feel it

Where ya going to tommarow?
Where ya goin' with the mask I 
found?
And I feel, and I feel
When the dogs begin to smell 
her
Will she smell alone?

And I feel, so much depends on
the weather
So it's raining in your bedroom?
And I see, that these are the 
eyes of disarray
Would you even care?

And I feel it
And she feels it

Where ya going to tommarow?
Where yo goin' with the mask I
found?
And I feel, and I feel
When the dogs beging to smell 
her
Will she smell alone?

When the dogs go to find her
Got time, time, to wait for 
tommarow


Crackerman
----------
Kickin' as I'm tryin' to sleep
Got the mud beneath my
shoes
Rubber band, gun in hand
I wanna use

Roamin', roamin', roam
Get away, gotta get away
And I think I think too much
I don't care, yeah and I
don't care

Trippin' as I' thinkin'
'Bout a boy, his name was
Sue
He's a man, he's a man
Crackerman, crackerman


He's a woman too

And I'm thinkin'
While I'm thinkin'
And I'm thinkin'
While I'm thinkin'

Where the River Goes
--------------------
Yeah, I could hide in the calm of
the eye of the storm
And never blow away
Well, I'm a young man with a 
knife to my back
Some things never seem to
change

Nowhere to run to, nowhere to 
hide
Sing the song or keep it inside
Bought the farm, but the farmer
done died
Sing that song, sing that song
inside

Yeah, I wish I could live in the 
dream that I fly on tarred &
feathered wings
Well, I'm losing a game of reality
dice where the dealer never ever
plays

I wanna be as big as a mountain
I wanna fly as high as the sun
I wanna know what the rent's
like in heaven
I wanna know where the river 
goes

Yeah, I could hide in the calf of
the eye of the storm
And never blow away
Well, I'm a young man with 
a knife to my back
Some things never seem to 
change

If I was stronger
I could be a mountain range
If night was longer
Could I escape the day?
