                   CAPITOL'S SKINNY PUPPY ARRESTED IN AN
                        ALLEGED VIVISECTION MISHAP


Nettwerk/Capitol Records artists SKINNY PUPPY were arrested Sunday, October
23, following their show in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Arrested for disorderly
conduct following a misunderstanding about a portion of their live
performance intended to protest animal vivisection, the band had to spend
the night in jail but were released the following day.

Currently on the Head Trauma Tour in support of their recently released LP
VIVIsectVI, SKINNY PUPPY simulates an "operation" on a toy stuffed animal
named "Chud" as part of the show, graphically symbolizing the horrors of
vivisection research.  Apparently an audience member mistook "Chud" for a
real dog and called the police.

Without identifying themselves, two plain-clothed police officers entered
their dressing room after the show demanding to see the dog.  Words were
exchanged between SKINNY PUPPY and the officers.  As a result, bandmembers
Ogre, Cevin Key, and the tour manager Dan McGee were arrested for
disorderly conduct.  They were released after their night in jail and fined
$200.00.

Bandmember Ogre issued a statement about the incident, "I find it
paradoxical that the police can justify arresting us on the assumption that
we mutilate and experiment on live animals for a theatrical performance
when the inhuman reality is that it occurs in over 300 laboratories a day."

SKINNY PUPPY has long been outspoken about protesting the use of animals
for research and, in fact, chose their name to emphasize their feelings
about the issue.
