        Amazing grace, how sweet the Earth 
        that bore a witch like me! 
        I once was burned, now I survive, 
        was hung and now I sing. 
  
        T'was grace that drew down the moon 
        and grace that raised the seas. 
        The magic in the people's will 
        will set our Mother free. 
  
        We face the East and breathe the winds 
        that move across this earth. 
        From gentle breeze to hurricane 
        our breath will bring forth the change. 
  
        Turn towards the South and feel the fire 
        that burns in you and me. 
        The spirit's flame will rise again 
        and burn eternally.
  
        We greet the West, our souls awash 
        in tides of primal birth. 
        Our tears and blood, our pain and love 
        will cleanse and heal the earth. 
  
        Reach into the North and know your roots 
        down deep ancestral caves. 
        We find the wisdom of the Crone, 
        Of circles we are made. 
  
        Amazing earth, enduring life, 
        from death into rebirth. 
        T'is earth I am and earth I love 
        and earth I'll always be. 
  
        Amazing grace, how sweet the Earth 
        that bore witches like we. 
        We once were burned, now we survive, 
        were hung and now we sing. 
  
        Goddess bless, so mote it be, 
        Our magic spirals on.
        Merry meet and merry part
        and merry meet again.
