                     T.H.C. Synthesis                            
                     ----------------                           


I once had the plans for three tetrahydracanibinol synthethizing
procedures. Unfortunately I got raided and the R.C.M.P. seized them
along with lab equipment and real pot.  What I can remember from the
plans was a bit of the Adam's Synthesis. Adam's synthesis:(delta-9) Any
combination of resourcinol...an industrial chemical and citrol...another
industrial chemical used for fragrances will produce synthetic THC. The
hard part is the catylyst, I'm sorry I can't remember its name. All I
know is that if you inhaled its fumes it would be fatal and a special
mixing device using a magnet had to be constructed in order to safely
get the necessary reaction. If you wish to persue this further there
might be other catylysts that may accomplish the samething or inquire
about chemicals that cause death when inhaled to narrow it down.  Its
probably easier to grow your own. One other thing was that I also had
the plans to upgrade resourcinol so that the THC produced was 70 times
stronger than natural THC. I hope this has been of interest to you. I
appologize for its incompleteness.       .....DELTA-9
