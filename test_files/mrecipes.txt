* INTRODUCTION *

    Drugs are not central to anarchy, have nothing
to do with politics, and may be considered the
opposite of revolution, since their use tends to
create apathy.  The use of drugs comes under the
birth of a new culture.


    Many people after cleaning their grass throw
away the seeds, stems and twigs.  I would highly
recommend that you save these, as there are many
recipies for these odds and ends.  A tasty hot
drink that resembles tea can be made very simple
by tying up all the waste from your stash into a
piece of cheesecloth.  Use the quality you have
on hand, as the quantity will determine the
strength and potency.  Now, drop the cheesecloth
containing the grass into a kettle of water, and
bring the water to a boil.  Allow the kettle to
boil for a few minutes, and then remove it from
the flame and let it steep for another five
minutes with the grass still inside.  After this,
the drink is ready.  Just add sugar and lemon to
taste.
    If you decide against growing pot, and want
to eat your seeds, there is an interesting recipe
for "seed pancakes".  It is prepared by lightly
toasting a quarter cup of seeds into a large
frying pan.  Now, take the seeds from the frying
pan and add them to a mixture of one cup of pan-
cake mix, one egg, a quarter cup of milk, and one
tablespoon of butter.  Beat this mixture until it
is smooth and creamy.  Heat in a frying pan with
a small amount of butter, then pour in pancake
batter.  Turn the pancakes as they start to look
done, or when the edges begin to turn brown.
Repeat procedure until all the batter is used.
Serve pancakes with butter, maple syrup, and
honey.
    For a stimulating drink place eight ounces of
milk, a few spoonfuls sugar, a tablespoon malted
milk, half a banana, and a half tablespoon weed.
Keep the blender working for a few minutes, then
strain and serve.
    If you like candy, it's very simple to make
some using pot.  Take a quarter cup of powdered
weed and add water until it equals a full cup. Mix
this with four cups sugar and two and a half cups
corn syrup.  Now heat in a large pot to 310
degrees, and add red food coloring and mint
flavoring.  Remove the pot from the stove, and
allow the mixture to cool a little, before pouring
it onto wax paper.  When the candy's cool, cut it
into squares and eat.
    One of the most common recipies for cooking
with pot is spagetti.  This recipe doesn't take
too much special preparation: Just when you add
your oregano, add at the same time a quarter cup
of grass, and allow it to simmer with the sauce.
Be sure to use well-cleaned grass, until you can
get into eating twigs and stems.  Another way of
serving pot with spagetti is to grind it up very
fine and mix it with some ground cheese.  Then
sprinkle the cheese-pot mixture over the sauce
just before eating.
    Desert is probably the most important stage of
the meal, since it will be the last thing your
guests remember before they pass out all over your
table.  For an interesting dessert, grind a
quarter ounce of grass very finely, and add enough
water so it forms a paste.  Now seperately
dissolve one and a half cups sugar into two cups
milk.  Add to this your pot paste and one lemon
rind grind.  Beat in a half cup heavy cream, until
the mixture is firm and thick.  Now pour the
mixture into ice cube trays and freeze.  Just
before you're ready to serve, rebeat the frozen
mush until it becomes light and fluffy.

Here are some additional recipies for cooking with
pot and hash:
