NITROUS OXIDE
-------------

  THE PREPARATION FOR NITROUS OXIDE IS SO EASY, THAT MOST READERS WILL PROBABLY
NOT BELIEVE ME.  NITROUS OXIDE IS A COLORLESS GAS, WHICH IS SLIGHTLY SOLUBLE IN
WATER.  THE NAME 'LAUGHING GAS' COMES FROM THE FACT THAT IT CAUSES A SLIGHT 
HYSTERIA IF INHALED.  IT IS DENSER THAN AIR, AND HAS ANASTHETIC-LIKE EFFECTS,IN
ADDITION TO HYSTERIA.  IT WAS USED AS A DENTAL ANASTHETIC FOR A FEW YEARS, BUT
COMPOUNDS WERE MADE THAT DID THE SAME JOB, BUT WITHOUT THE SIDE EFFECT.   IT IS
SOMETIMES USED TO BOOST ENGINES TEMPORARILY, BUT I WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT 
TYPE OF THING.  I DO KNOW THAT UNLESS YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING, THE
BOOSTING PROCESS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND EXTREMELY DAMAGING TO THE ENGINE.
.  I DO NOT SUGGEST THAT YOU JUST PRESSURIZE THE STUFF, AND SEND BURSTS OF IT
 TO YOUR ENGINE.

MATERIALS:
----------
10 GRAMS OF AMMONIUM NITRATE
TESTUBE OR ERLENMYER FLASK
RUBBER STOPPER W/HOLE FOR TUBING
3 INCH GLASS TUBE
APPX 24 INCHES RUBBER TUBE
BOTTLE, LARGE
FILTER MASK OR GAS MASK(OPTIONAL)
TWO PIECES OF WOOD, OF A SIZE TO FIT INSIDE THE PAN WITH ABOUT A ONE INCH SPACE
    IN BETWEEN THE WOOD. APPX1 1/2 TO 1 INCH THICK.
SOURCE OF FLAME
CLAMP, FOR TEST TUBE
TAPE (ELECTRICAL)
GLASS PLATE AS WIDE AND LONG AS THE MOUTH OF THE BOTTLE

PROCEDURE:
----------
 1. PLACE THE AMMONIUM NITRATE INSIDE THE TEST TUBE.  LEAVE LOOSE, AND MAKE
SURE THAT IT WILL NOT BE UNDER SEVERE PRESSURE.

 2. NOW, PLACE THE GLASS TUBE ALL THE EAY THROUGH THE STOPPER.  IT MUST BE
ALL THE WAY THROUGH:
              *******
              *******
           ++++++++++++++
              *******
              *******
*=RUBBER, +=TUBE
   THIS IS SO THAT THE RUBBER WILL NOT CLOSE OFF ON THE INSIDE, AND THE 
RESULTING PRESSURE DOES NOT SHOOT THE TOP OFF!!!!!!!!

 3. PLACE THE STOPPER INSIDE THE TEST TUBE.  PLACE ONE END OF THE RUBBER TUBING
ON THE PROJECTING END OF THE GLASS TUBE.  TAPE THE CONNECTION TIGHTLY, SO THAT
THERE IS NO LEAKAGE.

 4. NOW, PLACE THE TWO BOARDS IN THE PAN LIKE SHOWN:

             ***********
             *++++ ++++*
             *++++ ++++*
             *++++ ++++*
             *++++ ++++*
             *++++ ++++*
             ***********
  +=WOOD, *= PAN RIM.
   THE SPACE IN THE CENTER IS WHERE THE RUBBER TUBING WILL GO.

 5. FILL THE PAN WITH WATER SO THAT IT RISES APPX. 1/2 INCH ABOVE THE SPACE
IN THE CENTER.

 6. FILL THE BOTTLE WITH WATER AS CLOSE TO THE TOP AS YOU CAN.  PLACE THE GLASS
PLATE OVER THE TOP OF THE BOTTLE AND TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN IN THE PAN , SO THAT
NO WATER ESCAPES FROM THE BOTTLE.  MOVE THE MOUTH OF THE BOTTLE OVER THE SPACE.

 7. CLAMP THE TEST TUBE, AT A 30 DEGREE ANGLE,  TO SOMETHING, AND PLACE IT
 ABOUT 1/2 TO 1 INCH ABOVE FLAME OF THE BURNER, OR WHATEVER YOU ARE USING.  DO
 NOT USE A GAS STOVE.  AND DO NOT PLACE THE TEST TUBE OVER THE FLAME, YET. 
 ESTIMATE, BY LIGHTING THE BURNER, AND GAUGING THE DISTANCE.

 8. PLACE THE PAN CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE TEST TUBE SO THAT THE RUBBER TUBE MAY BE
MOVED ANYWHERE WITHIN THE PAN.  MAKE SURE, HOWEVER, THAT THE BOTTLE IS NEARER
THE FAR END.  NITROUS OXIDE IS VERY FLAMMABLE.  IN OTHER WORDS, JUST CLOSE 
ENOUGH TO THE TUBE FOR THE RUBBER TUBING TO BE PLACED IN THE 'NOTCH OR SPACE'
UNDER THE MOUTH OF THE BOTTLE.  (DON'T PLACE THE TUBE THERE NOW.)

 9. NOW, HEAT THE AMMONIUM NITRATE GENTLY.  IF IT GETS TOO HOT, IT WILL 
EXPLODE, AND YOU WILL BE MISSING A FEW IMPORTANT THINGS, LIKE EYES FOR
INSTANCE.  DO THIS BY MOVING THE BURNER IN AND OUT NEAR THE TEST TUBE KEEP THE
 END OF THE RUBBER TUBE AS FAR AWAY FROM THE FLAME AS POSSIBLE!!!!!  THIS STEP
 IS TO DRIVE THE AIR OUT OF THE TUBE.  AFTER ABOUT 1 MINUTE OR SO OF THIS (IT
 DEPENDS UPON HOW CLOSE YOU HAVE THE FALME, AND THE INTERVALS OF MOVING THE
 BURNER CLOSER AND FURTHER), PLACE THE END OF THE RUBBER TUBE IN THE WATER
 UNDER THE MOUTH OF THE BOTTLE.  THE NITROUS OXIDE WILL BUBBLE INTO THE BOTTLE.
  WHEN BUBBLES BEGIN APPEARING IN THE WATER AROUND THE BOTTLE, SWITCH BOTTLES.
  AS WITH ALL HOMEMADE CHEMICALS, DO NOT STORE FOR LONG.  IF YOU MUST, STORE IT
IN A COOL DRY PLACE, MOUTH UP, SEALED WITH TAPE, THEN WAX.  DO NOT PREPARE THE 
WAX NEAR THE NITROUS OXIDE.

  NOTES:
  ------

  1. YOU WILL WANT TO WEAR A FILTER OR A GAS MASK IF POSSIBLE, AND DO THIS IN
A WELL VENTILATED AREA.

  2. 10 GRAMS OF AMMONIUM NITRATE, IF COMPLETELY USED, WILL FORM 5+1/2 GRAMS OF
NITROUS OXIDE.  THIS GAS WOULD OCCUPY 2.8 LITERS OF SPACE AT 0 DEGRESS C AND
160 MM OF MERCURY, BAROMETRIC PRESSURE.  SINCE TEMPERATURE WILL BE APPX. 27 
DEGREES, YOU WILL PRODUCE FAR MORE THAN 2.8 LITERS.  YOU WILL OBVIOUSLY NEED
MORE THAN ONE BOTTLE.  HOW MUCH YOU MAKE IS UP TO YOU, BUT I WOULDN'T MAKE MORE
THAN TWO BOTTLES UNLESS I HAD SOME MEANS OF COMPRESSION.  AND SINCE COMPRESSION
CAUSES HEAT, IT MAY IGNITE THE NITROUS OXIDE.  NOT TO MENTION THAT THE
COMPRESSING EQUIPMENT IS VERY EXPENSIVE.

  3. THE MATERIAL LEFT INSIDE THE TEST TUBE IS A MIXTURE OF WATER AND AMMONIUM
NITRATE, HYDRATED.  DISCARD IT.

  4. IF NO GAS IS APPEARING, DECREASE THE INTERVALS OF MOVING THE BURNER AWAY
FROM THE HEAT SOURCE.  IT WILL EXPLODE IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL, SO FOLLOW ALL
DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY. IT MAY NOT EVENBE NECESSARY TO DO THE MOVING IN AND OUT 
OF THE BURNER, BUT BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY, (AND IF YOU FUCK UP, YOU WILL INDEED
BE VERY SORRY)

  5. THE CHEMICAL FORMULA:
       NH NO -->  N O + 2H O
         4  3      2      2

  6. MAKE SURE THAT THE TEST TUBE IS NO MORE THAT 1/4 FULL.  A FLASK MAY WORK
JUST AS WELL, ALTHOUGH SOME MODIFICATIONS WILL HAVE TO BE MADE.

  7. AMMONIUM NITRATE IS A FERTILIZER, SO CHECK A PLANT STORE, ETC.  BEWARE OF
TOO MANY IMPURITIES, HOWEVER, AS THIS INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE A.N.

  8. ONE LAST NOTE:  80 GRAMS WILL PRODUCE 1 MOLE OF N2O(44 GRAMS, 22.4 LITERS,
AT STANDARD CONDITIONS)

DISCLAIMER:  THIS IS RATHER DANGEROUS.  IT IS MUCH LIKE PRODUCING OXYGEN FROM
 POTASSIUM CHLORATE.  IF YOU'VE DONE THIS (OXYGEN..) IT SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM FOR YOU.  IF NOT, BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL.
