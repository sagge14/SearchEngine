     Morrigan are mistresses of all witchcraft 
 
 Lugh said:

 I bid you, unless you know of another who is master 
 of all these arts, take me to Nuada Airgitlamh, 
 take me to Nuada, king of the Tutha de Danann. 
 
 The gatekeeper went to Nuada. 
 When Nuada heard of Lugh's coming he said: 
 Let him come in, for never has his like entered 
 this fortress 
 
 Lugh the Il-Dana was admitted to the Tara 
 Lugh Samildanach was admitted to the palace of the Tuatha De 
 Lugh master of all arts found his place amongst the Tuatha de Denann

                UPON MISTAKING HER FOR THE SUNRISE 
 
 My Lady, was it you I saw upon the grassy field this morn? 
 I thought it was the dawn come up above the hills and fields of corn! 
 The starlight paled, the rooster crowed, the Herald blew the morning horn, 
 I thought it was the dawn come up, or Resurrection's glorious Morn! 
  
 I thought the hall was set with gold, your hair reflected such a light! 
 My Lady, was it you I saw among the banqueters that night? 
 I walked as mazed in Elfin Halls, and wared a Dragon's jealous Sight! 
 I thought the Hall was set with gold, for golden was that joyful night! 
  
 My Lady, was it you I saw, a-combing spun-gold tresses fair? 
 Was it The Lady of the Lake, or Yseult of the Golden Hair? 
 Thine eyes shone out in candle-light and laughed at me a-standing there! 
 My Lady, was it you I saw, or was it dawn a-sitting where 
                                    I watched Her comb Her golden Hair?

                         MY HARP AND LUTE 
 
               My Harp and Lute are wood and wire, 
                  crafted lovingly and slow 
               Their music brings me from the pain 
                  of this frail World here below 
               and takes me to the Doors of Heav'n; 
                  whither upward I would go. 
 
               My Drum's a heartbeat, keeping time, 
                  Marks the measure of the tune 
               Counts the moments of the Dance 
                  Sets the sygil of the Rune. 
               On that rock I build my Song 
                  Singing to the rising Moon. 
 
               Harp and Lute, and Drum....and Words; 
                  Words to sweep, and twist, and roll, 
               Words the weft to weave the web 
                  Woven with a single goal: 
               A Web to catch My Lady's heart; 
                  A Web to touch My Lady's Soul.

        The Red Cat walked into my life, with no warning she came; 
        Fearful and trembling, but still she came, 
        Looking at me thru eyes that saw a thousand years. 
        Filling my home with laughter, her hair aflame. 
 
        The Red Cat walked into my life, with no warning she came; 
        Free, unfettered, breaking her chains 
        That bound her to her mundane daily fears. 
        Filling my home with joy, her hair aflame. 
 
        The Red Cat walked into my life, with no warning she came; 
        Graceful and gentle, worthy of her name, 
        Giving me my children, hearts I hold so dear; 
        Gracing my home with sons and daughters, her hair aflame. 
 
                Shy One, let us be gone to the hills 
                And join the Sidhe in their revels, 
                Leaving the world behind us; 
                On a white horse will we ride, with a hound. 
 
        The Red Cat walked into my life, 
        With no warning she came!

                   Hi said the Norn, sittin in the sand 
                   once I talked to a great Grey Man 
                   spun three times and said with a sigh 
                   hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!

                   Hi said the Lady, dressed in green 
                   prettiest thing I've ever seen 
                   she went down underneath the hill 
                   and came back out of her own free will 
 
                   Brian Boru, on Irish ground 
                   walked three times the Island round 
                   Norsemen came lookin for a fight 
                   just another Irish Saturday night! 
 
                   Hi said Lugh on the banquest night 
                   a poet and a player and a good wheelwright 
                   a harper and a warrior and none the least: 
                   a Druid and he got in to the Feast! 
 
                   Harold Haardrada's face was red! 
                   Came to Britain and he wound up dead 
                   Stamford Bridge is where he's found 
                   got six feet of English ground 
 
                   the Legion with it's Eagles bright 
                   marched into the Pictish night 
                   met them there upon the sand 
                   gave em up to the Wicker Man! 
 
                   eight-legged steed and hound of Hel 
                   the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well 
                   fire burn and fire spark 
                   are you then feared of the dark? 
 
                   The Circle forms, the Circle flows 
                   the Circle goes where no man knows 
                   Hail to the Lady, one in three: 
                   Present is Past and Past is Me! 
 
                   Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight 
                   all thru the Day all thru the Night 
                   Hail to the Lady, one in Three 
                   Present is Past and Past is Thee!        
 
                   Hi said the Lady dressed in white 
                   sang the Day and sang the Night 
                   sang the Land and sang the Sea 
                   sang the Song, and then sang Me! 
 
                   (extra verses) Salt and oil and mirror bright 
                                  fire and fleet and candlelight 
                                  by fin and feather, leaf and tree, 
                                  fill the cup and blessed be! 
 
                                  From the misty crystal sea 
                                  came the Lady to the lea 
                                  Sword and Roses in Her Hand 
                                  spread their seeds thruout the Land 
 
                                  Came the Stag from oaken wood 
                                  saw the Lady where she stood 
                                  by the fire burning bright 
                                  came to know his heart's delight! 
 
                   (end of extra verses) 
 
                   By Sword and Harp, and Irish Hound 
                   Blessed Be: the Day I've found 
                   Hail to the Lady, one in Three 
                   Present is Past and Past is WE 
 
                   By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn 
                   bledded be the Day you're born! 
                   Fire burn and fire bright 
                   walk in safety thru the night
