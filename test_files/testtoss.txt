                       Testing The Tosser
                   (Sung to Waltzing Matilda)
                                                    -- Dr. Mabuse, d.o.a.

Once a mighty SysOp changed his tosser for more speed.
He had duly registered with program fees
* Then he tossed and he read that the messages were lost in space.
"Please come a-testing the tosser with me!"

    Testing the tosser, Testing the tosser
    "Please come a-testing the tosser with me!"
    *
    "Please come a-testing the tosser with me!"

Then the frazzled SysOp checked and then re-checked his feeds.
"I hope it'll work this time," said he.
* But when he tossed S&M into CHESS he was cut instantly.
"Please come a-testing the tosser with me!"

    (chorus)

Poof went the node number, SysOp couldn't take the heat.
Deleted every program from Drive C:.
* But his ghost may be heard as you read the echos in the nets.
"Please come a-testing the tosser with me!"

    (chorus)

Enjoy.
