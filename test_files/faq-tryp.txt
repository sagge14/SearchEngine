5-fluorotryptamine, 6-fluorotryptamine and 5- and 6-fluorotryptophans.

MAO Inhibitors and Tryptamines

Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is the primary inactivation pathway of most
tryptamines. Because of this, inhibitors of the MAO enzyme (MAOIs) can be
used to potentiate the effects of tryptamines and to make DMT and 5-MeO-DMT
orally active.

MAO inhibitors fall into two classes: Irreversible and reversible MAOIs.
Irreversible MAOIs (e.g. the hydrazides iproniazid and phenelzine) bind 
permanently to the enzyme and cause MAO inhibition lasting 1-2 weeks after
ingestion. They are used clinically to treat depression. Reversible MAOIs,
such as moclobemid and the beta-carbolines harmine and harmaline, are 
effective for much shorter time, maybe up to 24 hours. Reversible MAOIs are
not widely used clinically, but recreational drug users around the world
prefer them despite the lack of scientific studies about their effects in
humans.

Natives of Amazon have traditionally combined Banisteriopsis caapi vine,
which contains harmine, harmaline and related beta-carbolines, with DMT-
containing plants to make an orally active brew called ayahuasca. Other 
plants containing harmine and/or harmaline can be substituted for B.
caapi. The usual 'North-American ayahuasca' consists of Peganum harmala 
seeds and Desmanthus illinoensis roots, and in Australian 'acaciahuasca'
leaves of Acacia complanata are combined with material from DMT-containing
acacias (the effectivity of this mixture hasn't been confirmed). MAOIs
have also been used to potentiate the effects of mushrooms containing 
psilocybin. Terence McKenna has mentioned chocolate being a weak MAOI, which 
could be a reason for the popular habit of ingesting mushrooms with cocoa.

Peganum harmala (Syrian rue) seeds are the most concentrated natural source
of harmine and harmaline - about 3% of their weight consists of these
alkaloids. Banisteriopsis caapi has been found to contain from 0.18% to 
1.36% beta-carbolines, with the concentration of harmine being from 0.057%
to 0.635% (McKenna et al. 1984). According to anecdotal reports one gram 
of P. harmala seeds ingested inhibits MAO enough to make DMT orally active.

Harmine and harmaline are hallucinogenic on their own with doses
starting from around 300 mg (Naranjo 1967). They have little emotional
or 'psychedelic' effects, but produce strong visual hallucinations. Because of
this the natives of Amazon often add larger amounts (75-100 cm of stem per
dose) of B. caapi to ayahuasca brew than is needed for MAO inhibition 
(Luna 1984).

There are significant dangers in using MAO inhibitors. MAOIs potentiate 
the cardiovascular effects of tyramine and other monoamines found in
foods. Ingestion of aged cheese, beer, wine, pickled herring, chicken liver,
yeast, large amounts of coffee, citrus fruits, canned figs, broad beans,
chocolate or cream while MAO is inhibited can cause a hypertensive
crisis including a dangerous rise in blood pressure. Effects of
amphetamines, general anaesthetics, sedatives, anti-histamines, alcohol,
potent analgesics and anticholinergic and antidepressant agents are
prolonged and intensified. Overdosage of MAOIs by themselves is also
possible with effects including hyperreflexia and convulsions.

Self-Synthesis of DMT Derivatives

Tryptamine derivatives and beta-Carbolines have been detected as
endogenous metabolites in mammals, including humans. Methyl transferases
that catalyze the synthesis of tryptamines, including DMT, 5-MeO-DMT and
bufotenine, are found in human lung, brain, cerebrospinal fluid, liver
and heart (McKenna & Towers 1984). In the pineal gland MAO is the primary 
inactivation pathway of serotonin, a neurotransmitter synthesized from the 
amino acid tryptophan. If MAO is blocked by harmine, harmaline or other MAO 
inhibitors serotonin can be converted by the methyltransferase enzymes 
HIOMT and INMT into psychedelic tryptamines (serotonin --(HIOMT)--> 
5-MeO-trypt. --(2*INMT)--> 5-MeO-DMT).

So, ingesting l-tryptophan to increase serotonin levels, a candy bar to 
increase the amount of tryptophan getting to your brain and natural
plant material containing 25-50 mg harmine/harmaline to block MAO, all at the
same time, is supposed to cause your pineal gland to synthesize substantial 
amounts of 5-MeO-DMT (Most 1986). This is extremely dangerous for persons 
with existing amine imbalance or schizophrenia. For normal, healthy people 
possible consequences are bad. 

A potent inhibitor of INMT, which is a necessary enzyme for the synthesis
of DMT and 5-MeO-DMT, is found in particularly high concentrations in the
pineal gland. A bypassing or inhibition of the synthesis of this inhibitor
might be responsible for trances and other psychedelic states achieved
"without drugs" (Strassman 1990). See Strassman's article for more info and 
speculation about the pineal gland.

Psychedelic Toads

Bufotenine and related 5-hydroxy-indolethylamines are common constituents
of venoms of the genera Hyla, Leptodactylus, Rana and Bufo. Bufotenine
is not psychedelic in reasonable doses (with larger doses there are
dangerous physiological side effects), but the skin of one species, Bufo
alvarius, contains 50-160 mg 5-MeO-DMT/g of skin (Daly & Witkop 1971).
It's the only Bufo species known to contain a hallucinogenic tryptamine
(McKenna & Towers 1984). Most (1984) gives instructions for collecting
and drying the venom:

  Fresh venom can easily be collected without harm to the toad. Use a flat 
  glass plate or any other smooth, nonporous surface at least 12-inches
  square. Hold the toad in front of the plate, which is fixed in a vertical 
  position. In this manner, the venom can be collected on the glass plate, 
  free of dirt and liquid released when the toad is handled. 
    When you are ready to begin, hold the toad firmly with one hand and, with
  the thumb and forefinger of your other hand, squeeze near the base of the 
  gland until the venom squirts out of the pores and onto the glass plate. Use
  this method to systematically collect the venom from each of the toad's 
  granular glands: those on the forearm, those on the tibia and femur of the 
  hind leg, and, of course, the parotoids on the neck. Each gland can be 
  squeezed a second time for an additional yield of venom if you allow the toad
  a one-hour rest preiod. After this the glands are empty and require four to
  to six weeks for regeneration.
    The venom is viscous and milky-white in color when first squeezed from the 
  glands. It begins to dry within minutes and acquires the color and texture 
  of rubber cement. Scrape the venom from the glass plate, dry it thoroughly,
  and store it in an airtight container until you are ready to smoke it. 
  
Davis and Weil (1992) smoked the venom and described what happened:
 
  In comparison to the pure compounds the toad venom appears longer lasting 
  and, because one does not completely lose contact with reality, far more 
  pleasant, even sensual. Shortly after inhalation I experienced warm flushing
  sensations, a sense of wonder and well-being, strong auditory hallucinations,
  which included an insect-cicada sound that ran across my mind and seemed to 
  link my body to the earth. Though I was indoors, there was a sense of the 
  feel of the earth, the dry desert soil passing through my fingers, the stars
  at midday, the scent of cactus and sage, the feel of dry leaves through hands.
  Strong visual hallucinations in orblike brilliance, diamond patterns that
  undulated across my visual field. The experience was in every sense pleasant,
  with no disturbing physical symptoms, no nausea, perhaps a slight sense of 
  increased heart rate. Warm waves coursed up and down my body. The effects
  lasted only a few minutes but a pleasant afterglow continued for almost an
  hour. (Wade Davis, personal observation, January 12, 1991)
 
  Profound alteration of consciousness within a few seconds of exhaling. I
  relax into a deep, peaceful interior awareness. There is nothing scary about
  the effects and no sense of toxicity. I try to describe my feelings but am
  unable to talk for the first five minutes and then only with some difficulty.
  This is a powerful psychoactive drug, one that I think would appear to most
  people who like the effects of hallucinogens. For the next hour I feel slow
  and velvety, with a slight pressure in my head. No long-lasting effects to
  report. (Andrew T. Weil, personal observation, January 12, 1991)

Genus:  Anadenanthera (Piptadenia)
species: peregrina
         colubrina

Black beans from these trees are toasted, pulverized and mixed with ashes
or calcined shells to make psychedelic snuff called yopo by Indians in 
Orinoco basin in Colombia, Venezuela and possibly in southern part of 
Brasilian Amazon. Yopo is blown into the nostrils through bamboo tubes
or snuffed by birdbone tubes. The trees grow in open plain areas, and 
leaves, bark and seeds contain DMT, 5-MeO-DMT and related compounds 
(Schultes 1976,1977; Pachter et al. 1959).

(Johns et al. 1966).

Family: Malpighiaceae
Genus:  Banisteriopsis
Species: rusbyana 
         argentea

Natives of western Amazon add DMT-containing leaves of the vine B. rusbyana
to a drink made from B. caapi, which contains beta-carbolines harmine and
harmaline, to heighten and lengthen the visions (Schultes 1977, Smith 1977).

Family: Myristicaceae
Genus:  Virola
Species: calophylla
	 calophylloidea
 	 rufula
	 sebifera

The bark resin of these trees is used to prepare hallucinogenic snuffs
in northwestern Brazil by boiling, drying and pulverizing it. Sometimes
leaves of a Justicia are added. The snuff acts rapidly and violently,
"effects include excitement, numbness of the limbs, twitching of facial
muscles, nausea, hallucinations, and finally a deep sleep; macroscopia is
frequent and enters into Waika beliefs about the spirits resident in the
drug." Snuffs made from V. theiodora bark contain up to 11% 5-MeO-DMT and 
DMT. Also leaves, roots and flowers contain DMT.

Amazonian Colombia natives roll small pellets of boiled resin in a
evaporated filtrate of bark ashes of Gustavia Poeppigiana and ingest
them to bring on a rapid intoxication (Smith 1977, Schultes 1977).
