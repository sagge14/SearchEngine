   Wish -

 This is the first day of my last days
 I buit it up now I take it apart climbed real high now fall down real far
 no need for me to stay the last thing I had I just threw away
 i put my faith in god and my trust in you
 now there nothing more fucked up I can do
 wish there was something real
 wish there was something true
 wish there was something real in this world full of you
 im the one with out a soul im the one with big fucking hole
 no new tale to tell twenty-six years on my way to hell
 gotta listen to your big time hard luck line bad luck fist fuck
 dont think youre the only one having fun
 you know me i hate every one
 wish there was something real
 wish there was something true
 wish there was something real in this world full of you
 i want to but i cant turn back but i want to

   Last -

 gave up trying to figure it out my head got lost along the way
 worn out from giving it up my soul i pissed it all away
 still stings these shattered nerves
 pigs we get what pigs deserve
 im going all the way down im leaving today
 come come come on youve got to fill me up
 come come gotta let me inside of you
 come come come on you gotta fix me up
 come come gotta let me inside you
 still feel it all slipping away
 but it doesnt matter anymore
 every bodys still slipping away
 but it doesnt matter anymore
 look trough these blackened eyes
 youll see ten-thousand lies
 my lips my promise but my heart is a whore
 come come come on youve got to fill me up
 come come gotta let me inside of you
 come come come on you gotta fix me up
 come come come gotta let me get through to you
 this isnt meant to last
 this is for right now
 i know its all getting away it comes to me as no surprise
 i know whats coming to is never going to arrive
 fresh blood through tired skin
 new sweat to drown me in
 dress up that rotten carcas just to make it look alive
 come come come on youve gotta fill me up
 come come gotta let me inside of you
 come come come on youve got to fix me up
 come come gotta let me get through ot you
 this isnt meant to last
 this is for right now
 i wish i could put the blame on you
 i want you to make me
 i want you to make me
 i want you to break me
 then I want you to throw me away

   Happiness in slavery -

 slave screams he thinks he knows what he wants
 slave screams he thinks he has something to say
 slave screams he hears but he doesnt want ot listen
 slave screams hes being beaten into submission
 dont open your eyes you wont like what you see
 the devils of truth steal the souls of the free
 dont open your eyes take it from me
 i have found
 you can find
 happiness in slavery
 slave screams he spends his life learning conformity
 slave screams he claims he has his own identity
 slave screems hes going to cause the system to fall
 slave screams but hes glad to be chained to the wall
 dont open your eyes you wont like what you see
 the blind have been blessed with security
 dont open your eyes take it from me
 i have found
 you can find
 happiness in slavery
 i dont know what i am doing i dont know where ive been
 human junk just words and so much skin
 stick my hands through the cage of this endless routine
 just some flesh caught in this big broken machine
 happiness in slavery
 happiness in slavery
 happiness in slavery
 that controls you
 happiness in slavery
 that controls you
 happiness in slavery
 that controls you
 happiness in slavery
 that controls you
 happiness in slavery

   Gave Up -

 perfect little dream
 the kind that hurt the most
 forgot how it feels
 well almost
 no one to blame always the same
 open my eyes
 wake up
 wake up
 wake up in flames
 it took you to make me realize
 it took you to make me realize
 it took you to make me realize
 it took you to make me see the light
 samshed up my sanity
 smashed my integrity
 smashed up what i belive in
 smashed up whats left for my
 smashed up my everything
 smashed up all that was true
 gonna smash my self to peices
 i dont know what else to do
 covered in hope and vaseline
 still cannot fix this broken machine
 watching the hole
 it used to be mine
 just watching it burn in my steady systematic decline
 of the trust i will betray
 give it to me
 i throw it all away
 after everything ive done
 i hate my self for what ive become
 i tried
 i gave up
 i tried
 i gave up
 i tried
 i gave up
 i tried
 i gave up
 throw it away

   Physical -

 i wanna take you baby
 i wanna take you out
 i wanna wine and dine you
 oh I wanna twist and twist and shout
 i want you all in my arms
 so soft in my bed
 youve got the key to my heart
 when you wear that sleek dress
 but your to physical physical
 to physical too me
 but your to physical physical to me
 i want your rough ass baby
 i want this right and right here
 i let your feel your danger
 i let you make this feeling clear here
 i want touch up your charms
 the heat heat of you breath
 i want to say all those things
 that are better off unsaid
 but your too physical
 physical
 to me
 but your too physical for me
 to physical too me
 your just to physical
 your just to physical
 to fucking physical
 no no no no, no
 too physical
 too, too physical
 your to physical


   SUCK - (original Pig Face)

 there is no god up in the sky tonight
 no sign of heaven anywhere in sight
 all that was true is left behind
 once i could see, now i am blind
 dont want these dreams you try to sell
 this disease i give to my self
 how does it feel...
 how does it feel...
 she makes it sweeter than the sun
 it gets too tight
 i come undone
 it bow my head to confess
 her temple walls are made of flesh
 runs up my arms till im on track
 itches my skin right off my back
 ill heal your wounds
 ill set you free
 im jesus christ on extasy
 how does it feel...
 how does it feel...
 (i feel so dirty)
 (deep inside)
 (i am so dirty)
 (on the inside)
 (i am so dirty)
 (on the inside)
 (i am so dirty)
 (i feel so dirty)
 ahhhhhh, nooooo...
 how does it feel...
 how does it feel...
 too suck
 suck
 suck
 (a thousand lips)
 (a thousand times)
 (a thousand throwts)
 (a thousand lungs)
 (a thousand ways)
 (too make it true)
 (i wan to do)
 (terrible things to you)
