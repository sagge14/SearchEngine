LONESOME TRAVELERS by Tom Rogers
(to the tune of "Lonesome Traveler")
 
     Chorus:
 
     I am a weary and a lonesome traveler
     I am a weary and a lonesome traveler
     I am a weary and a lonesome traveler
     I don't want to think about home
 
I traveled off to the G-7 conference
I traveled to Japan
and made my stomach nauseous
Is there another place to
Avoid the oval office?
I don't want to think about home
 
WAYFARIN' STRANGER by Tom Rogers
(to the tune of "Wayfarin' Stranger")
 
I am a poor wayfarin' stranger
A travelin' through this world of woe
And there's no polling nor primary elections
in that great land to which I go
 
     Chorus
 
     I'm going there to see my mother
     I'm going there no more to roam
     I'm going there to Kennebunkport
     I'm going there to my summer home
 
I still claim Texas as my home state
Though I don't live at this residence
If you have to spend any time in America
No state income taxes sure makes a lot of
            sense
 
Chorus
 
     I'm going there to see my mother
     I'm going there no more to roam
     I'm going there to Kennebunkport
     I'm going there to my summer home
