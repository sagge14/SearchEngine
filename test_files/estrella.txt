             BANNED FROM ESTRELLA

  Oh, we pulled into Estrella Park, a-lookin' for the War,
  Then searched 'round for a parking space for sixteen hours or more;
  So we went to the autocrat, who looked up with a smile,
  "Okay," she said, "Park over there! It's just three miles away"

      And we're banned from Estrella, everyone;
      Yes, we're banned from Estrella, we just had a little fun.
      We're gonna have a battle there, for just three days or four,
      In SunDragon, at the great Estrella War.

  We went to the evening's revels, a-following the drums
  Lookin' for some Tulley Dew, we really wanted some!
  Along came a bunch of dancers, and they looked mighty keen
  Alonzo fondled one of them; she was the Outland's Queen!  //OOPS!//

  We saw a bunch of Cavaliers, all dressed in fancy lace
  With polished boots and perfumed hair, each one a pretty face
  We thought we'd roust them out a bit; we took off at a run:
  Hrothgar took a musket ball! -Their- fops all carry -guns!-

  Jane wore Elizabethans, with hoops and lace and all
  And went off to the Royal tent to join in Giles' Ball
  The wind came up, and knocked us flat, it was an awful sight;
  Got under poor Jane's hoopskirts and she took off like a kite!

  Master Giles was walking 'round, with his fancy hat.
  Arnulf looked him up and down and exclaimed "Fancy that!"
  "I've traveled this world far and wide, a million miles or more,"
  "But a 'Lizabethan Navajo I have never seen before!"

  We all took off for Thunder, to listen to the drums
  And watch the belly-dancers where the fiery likker runs
  Lokisson was sweating hard, his eyes began to gleam;
  We dropped an ice cube down his pants and the damn thing turned to steam!
