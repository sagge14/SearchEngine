                            PRETTY HATE MACHINE

1) HEAD LIKE A HOLE

i'd rather die than give you control
head like a hole
black as your soul
i'd rather die than give you control
bow down before the one you serve
you're going to get what you deserve
you know who you are

2) TERRIBLE LIE

hey God, why are you doing this to me? 
am i not living up to what i'm supposed to be? 
why am i seething with this animosity? 
hey God, i think you owe me a great big apology
terrible lie
hey God, i really don't know what you mean 
seems like salvation comes only in my dreams 
i feel my hatred grow all the more extreme 
hey God, can this world really be as sad as it seems
terrible lie
don't take it away from me 
i need someone to hold on to 
don't lake it away from me 
i need someone to hold on to
hey God, there's nothing left for me to hide 
i lost my ignorance, security and pride 
i'm all alone in a world you must despise 
hey God, i believed the promises, the promises and lies
terrible lie
you made me throw it all away 
my morals left to decay 
how many you betray 
you've taken everything
terrible lie
my head is filled with disease 
my skin is begging you please 
i'm on my hands and knees 
i want so much to believe 
i need someone to hold on to 
i need someone to hold on to 
i need someone
i need someone 
i need someone to hold on to 
i give you everything my
sweet everything
hey God, i really don't know who i am 
in this worid of piss

3) DOWN IN IT

kinda like a cloud i was up way up in the sky and 
i was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe
sometimes i can't believe them myseif and i decided i was never coming down
just then 
a tiny little dot caught my eye it was just about too small to see 
but i watched it
way too long and that dot
was pulling me down
i was up above it  now i'm down in it
well shut up so what what does it matter now 
i was swimming in the haze now i crawl on the ground 
and everything i never liked about you is kind of seeping into me 
try to laugh about it now
but isn't it funny how everything works out " i guess the jokes on me," 
she said
i was up above it  now i'm down in it
i used to be so big and strong  
i used to know my right from wrong  
i used to never be afraid  
i used to be somebody 
used to have something inside 
now just this hole that's open wide  
i used to want it all 
i used to be somebody
i'll cross my heart and hope to die 
but the needle's already in my eye 
and all the world's weight is on my back and i don't even know why 
and what i used to think was me is just
a fading memory
i looked him right in the eye and said "goodbye"
i was up above it 
now i'm down in it

4) SANCTIFIED

it's still getting worse after everything i tried 
what if i found a way to wash
it all aside  
what if she touches with those fingertips 
as the words spill out like fire trom her lips
if she says come inside 
i'll come inside for her 
if she says give it all 
i'll give everything to her
i am justified  
i am purified 
i am sanctified 
inside you
Heaven's just a rumor she'll dispel 
as she walks me through the nicest parts of hell  
i still dream of lips i never should have kissed 
well she knows exactly what i can't resist
it she says come inside i'll come inside for her  
if she says give it all 
i'll give everything to her
i am justified  
i am purified 
i am sanctified 
inside you
i'm just caught up in another of her spells  
she's turning me into someone else
every day i hope and pray that this will end  
but when i can i do it all again
if she says come inside i'll come inside for her  
if she says give it all i'll
give everything to her
i am justified 
i am purified 
i am sanctified  
inside you
as surely as the blade's course is run 
maybe my kingdom's finally come

5) SOMETHING I CAN NEVER HAVE

i still recall the taste of my tears 
echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears 
my favorite dreams of you still wash ashore 
scraping through my head 'till i don't want
to sleep anymore
came on tell me 
make this all go away 
you make this all go away 
i'm down
to just one thing
and i'm starting to scare myself 
make this all go away you make this all go
away 
i just want something 
i just want something 
i can never have
you always were the one to show me how 
back then i couldn't do the things that i can do now
this thing is slowly taking me apart
grey would be the color if i had a heart
i just want something i can never have
in this place it seems like such a shame 
though it all looks different now, i know it's still the same
everywhere i look you're all i see 
just a fading fucking reminder of who i used to be
come on tell me 
make this all gn away 
you make this all go away  
i'm down to just one thing
and i'm starting to scare myself 
make this all go away 
you make this all go away 
i just want something 
i just want something 
i can never have 
i just want something 
i can never have
think i know what you meant 
that night on my bed 
still picking at this scab
i wish you were dead
your sweat and perry ellis 
just stains on my sheets

6) KINDA I WANT TO

i can't shake this feeling from my head  
there's a devil sleeping in my bed 
he's watchiny you from across the way 
i cannot make this feeling go away
i know it's not the right thing 
and i know it s not the good thing 
but
kinda i want to
i'm not sure of what i should do 
when everything i'm thinking of is you 
all of my excuses turn to lies 
maybe God will cover up his eyes
i know it's not the right thing and 
i know it's not the good thing  
but kinda i want to 
kinda i want to
maybe just for tonight 
we can pretend it's alright 
what's the price i pay 
i don't care what they say 
i want to 
i want to I'll take my chance tonight

7) SIN

you give me the reason 
you give me control 
i gave you my Purity 
my purity you stole 
did you think i wouldn't recognize this compromise 
am i just to stupid to realize
stale incense old sweat
and lies lies lies
it comes down to this 
your kiss 
your fist and your strain  
it get's under my skin  
within 
take in
the extent of my sin
you give me the anger 
you give me the nerve 
carry out the sentence  
i get what i deserve 
i'm just an effigy to be defaced 
to be disgraced 
your need for me has been replaced
and if i can't have
everything well then just give me a taste
it comes down to this  
your kiss  
your fist 
and your strain  
it get's under my skin 
within  take in
the extent of my sin

8) THATS WHAT I WANT

just when everything was making sense 
 you took away all my self-confidence 
now all that i've
been hearing must be true 
i guess i'm not the only boy for you
but that's what i get
how could you turn us into this? 
after you just taught me how to kiss you 
i told you i'd never say goodbye 
now i'm slipping on the tears you made me cry
but that's what i get
why does it come as a suprise  
to think that i was so naive  
maybe didn't mean so much 
but it meant everything to me

9) THE ONLY TIME

i'm drunk 
and right now i'm so in love with you 
and i don't want to think
too much about what we
should or shouldn't do  
lay my hands on Heaven and the sun and the monn and the stars  
while the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car 
nothing quite like the feel of something new
maybe i'm all messed up 
maybe i'm all messed up in you
but this is the only time i really feel alive 
this is the only time i really feel alive
i swear i just found everything i need 
the sweat in your eyes 
the blood in your veins are listening
to me 
well i want to drink it up and swim in it until i drown 
my moral standing is lying down
nothing quite like the feel of something new
maybe i'm all messed up 
maybe i'm all messed up in you
but this is the only time i really feel alive 
this is the only time i really feel alive
i can't help thinking Christ never had it like this

10) RINGFINGER

well you've got me working so hard lately 
working my hands until they bleed 
if i was twice the man i could be 
i'd still be half of what you need 
still you lead me and i follow  
anything you ask you know i'll do 
but this one act of consecration is what i ask of you
ringfinger 
promise carved in stone 
deeper than the sea 
ringfinger 
sever flesh and bone
and offer it to me
you just leave me nailed here 
hanging like Jesus on this cross 
i'll be dying for your sins
and aiding to the cause
ringfinger 
promise carved in stone 
deeper than the sea 
ringfinger 
sever flesh and bone
and offer it to me
wrap my eyes in bandages 
confessions i see through 
i get everything i want
when i get
part of you
ringfinger 
promise carved in stone 
deeper than the sea 
ringfinger 
sever flesh and bone
and offer it to me 
ringfinger 
promise carved in stone 
deeper than the sea
ringlinger 
devil's
flesh and bone do something for me
i'm so tired i can't get to sleep 
and the squeaking of the bed is right in
time with the song that's repeating in my head 
i just want you to know
"when i do it i only think of you."
