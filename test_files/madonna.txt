				"Like a loser"
		    To the tune of "Like a virgin" - Madonna

	    Some of the syllables don't fit, that's your tough shit.

I finally learned about A.E., Somehow I found it out,
I'm pretty new, but I have K00L WAREZ, Like Sneakers and Bug attack.

You may think, I'm a geek,
But my friends, Think I'm really neat.

Cause I always Post, Yeah, I al-way-s post,
K-K00L RAD NU WAREZ!

Like a loser, Calling for the very first time,
Like a lo-se-r, You can tell that, they are grime.

Gonna give you all my WAREZ, dude!  They are the RADDEST games!
Been erasing all Credits, and putting my name in.

I'm the Best, there's no test.  I won't fall, cause I always call,
But you look at me, Yeah, you look at me, I just tie it up!

Like a Loser, Posting for the very first time,
Like a Lo-se-r, You can tell that, They waste time.

Wohh-Wohh, Wohh-wohh, Ahhh!

I'm so fine, with the time, Yes I'm K00L, Yes I do Drink Beer!
And that's even though, Yeah, that's even though, I am only 12!

Like a Loser, ragging for the very first time,
Like a Lo-se-r, You can know that, They aren't sublime.

Like a loser, ooh hoo, Like a L0ZER, We know they are Grime,
When we Rag them, and destroy them, and Blacklist them, ooh hoo ohh wohh ohh,

Oh baby, baby, baby...

You can tell they're calling,   For the very first time....
