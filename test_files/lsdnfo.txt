MAKING LSD
------ ---
           
                                       
   Common LSD, being of the strangest drugs, available to people on the
black market, is not too hard to make in your average run-of-the-mill
kitchen. LSD (Lysergic acid Diethylamide) is a complex organic mixure that
gives some people (most) a trip to the moon or other nearby celestial
body.


ITEMS NEEDED:
----- ------
 
1-About 200-250 grams of MORNING GLORY SEEDS or BAY HAWAIIAN WOOD ROSE   
SEEDS. The Morning Glory seeds can be obtained at most plant nurseries.   

2-200 cc. of petroleum ether

3-Small piece of window screen or a strainer

4-A couple of large glasses           

5-cookie tray (an old one, never to be used again)

6-260 cc. of wood alcohol (call your local drug store).                     

7-Capsule containers (jel)

=========================================================================

Let's get started:
 
1.  Grind up about 170 grams of Morning Glory Seeds.                   

2.  In 145 cc. of petroleum ether, soak the seeds for two or three days.

3.  With screen, filter the liquid thru it and save the seed mush and 
allow it to dry completely.

4.  Let the mush soak in 130 cc. of wood alcohol.

5.  Filter solution again only.  Save the liquid in a large glass jar.

6.  Soak the seed mush again in 130 cc. of wood alcohol for two more days. 

7.  Filter out the mush and keep the liquid.  Now, get the liquid that was
saved in step 5.

8.  Now, pour both liquids in a cookie tray and let it dry.                   

9.  When all the liquid has dried, a yellowish gummy looking substance will
appear on the cookie sheet.        

10. Take the yellow gum and put this into capsules.

=========================================================================

You can get the capsules just by buying something like DEXITRIM or some 
other pill.  Even CONTACT comes in jel capsules.  Just empty them out and     
put the yellow gum in the capsules.  Allow the capsules to sit over night   
for best results.

 
34 Grams of morning glory=1 trip to da moon
18 Grams of hawaiian wood=Another trip to da moon

WELCOME TO MY FILE ON LSD. IN THIS I

LSD FROM THE BOOK ANARCHISTS COOKBOOK

----------------------------------------
LSD
  I THINK, OF ALL THE DRUGS ON THE BLACK
MARKET TODAY, LSD IS THE MOST INTER-
ESTING AND THE STRANGEST. IT IS THE MOST
RECENT MAJOR DRUG TO COME TO LIFE IN THE
PSYCHEDELIC SUBCULTURE. HUXLEY EXPERIMEN
TED WITH MESCALINE MANY YEARS BEFORE
PSYCHEDELICS REACHED THEIR MASS-MARKET
PROPORTIONS,BUT THIS EXPERIMENTATION
WAS NOT WITH THE SAME FRAME OF MIND AS
THESE DRUGS ARE HANDLED TODAY. PROBABLY
THE GREAT-GRANDDADDY TO THE WHOLE
PSYCHEDELIC COMMUNITY WAS ANTONIN ARTAUD
, WHO PERSONALLY EXPERIMANTED WITH
PEYOTE IN MEXICO. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
HUXLEY'S AND ARTAUD'S EXPERIMENTATION
WAS THAT HUXLEY MANAGED TO KEEP HIS
EXPERIENCES UNDER LABATORY CONTROL,
WHICH HE SET UP HIMSELF,WHEREAS ARTAUD
ALLOWED HIS EXPERIENCES TO BECOME PART
OF HIS LIFE. ARTAUD WAS CHANGED BY HIS
ENCOUNTERS WITH PEYOTE, WAS THIS BAD?
A DIRTY SHIRT IS ALSO CHANGED WHEN
IT IS WASHED. THROUGH THIS CHANGE ARTAUD
WAS ABLE TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND IDEAS
AND CONCEPTS ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL.
HE WAS ABLE TO TEAR APART
RATIONALIZATIONS, WITH OUT REGAURD FOR
CONTEMPORARY METHODS OF ORGANIZATION,
OR EVEN CONTEMPORARY VERSIONS OF TRUTH.
ARTAUD FOUND,IN HIS OWN WAY,HIS OWN
TRUTHS AND HIS OWN STRUCTURES OF VALUE.
THEY LOCKED HIM UP...

  I DIED AT RODEZ UNDER ELECTROSHOCK.

  I DIED. LEGALLY AND MEDICALLY DIED.

ELECTROSHOCK COMA LASTS 15 MINUTES.
A HALF AND HOUR OR MORE THEN THE
PATIENT BRETHES.

NOW ONE HOUR AFTER THE SHOCK,I STILL HAD
HAD NOT AWADEND AND HAD STOPED BREATHI
. SURPRISED AT MY ABNORMAL RIDGIDRY, AN
ATTENDENT HAD GONE TO GET HE PHYSISION
IN CHARGE,WHO,AFTER EXAMINING ME,FOUND
NO MORE SIGNS OF LIFE IN ME.

THIS PASSAGE WAS TAKEN FROM THE ARTAUD
ANTHOLOGY. I FIND THIS IMPOSSIBLE
TO THROW THIS OF AS THE RAVINGS
OF A MADMAN FOR,IF THAT BE TRUE,
THAN THERE CAN BE NO TRUTH, ONLY MADNES
AND SANITY, LOGIC AND ILLOGIC.


LSD HAS NEVER CAUSED INSANITY. IT DOES
NOT HAVE THAT POWER. ALL LSD DOES IS
ALLOW A MAN TO LOOK UPON ORDINARY THINGS
AND EVEN ON HIMSELF MANY TIMES FOR THE
FIRST TIME. LSD CANNOT BRINGOUT LATENT
QUALITIES IN YOUR PERSONALITY. IT CANNOT
MAKE YOU CRAZY,JUST AS IT CANNOT MAKE
YOU INTO A WARMER MORE BEUTIFULL PERSON.
WHAT LSD CAN DO IS SHOW YOU WHAT YOU AS
A PERSON IS COMPRISED OF. LSD IS NOTHING
BUT A MEDIUM TO DISCOVER THE ESSANCE OF
BEING.

 LSD HAS BEEN ILLEGAL FOR YEARS NOW,
MAKING IT AVAILABLE ON THE BLACK MARKET.
WHEN BUYING ANYTHING ON THE BLACK MARKET
FOLLOW THESE IMORTANT RULES
(TG: THESE ARE JUST COMMON SENSE BUT
SOME PEOPLE DONT USE IT)

 1. NEVER BUY OF THE STREET OF FROM A
    STRANGER.

 2. NEVER FRONT MONEY.

 3. IF YOU ARE HOLDING A LARGE SUM OF
    MONEY NEVER GO ALONE ANYWHERE
    WITH SOMEONE YOU DONT TRUST, MANY
    DEALERS ARE IN REALITY JUKIES TOO.

 4. NEVER TAKE A WEAPON WITH YOU WHEN
    DEALING WITH DOPE.

 5. NEVER BUY A LARGE QUANTITY WITHOUT
    SAMPLING IT FIRST

 6. IF YOUR ARE IN THE DEALERS APARTMENT
    NEVER EXCEPT FOOD FROM HIM.

 7. BAD ACID IS USUALLY NOTHING MORE
    THAN SPEED, OR RAT POISON.

 8. NEVER BUY L.B.J. IT IS A MIX OF
    ACID,BELLODONNA,HEROIN.

SINCE MOST OF US CANT GET ACCESS TO A
LAB I WILL GO RIGHT TO THE SECTION ON
MAKIND LSD IN YOU KITCHIN,
----------------------------------------
MAKING LSD IN YOU KITCHIN
 1. GRIND UP 150 GRAMS OF MORNING GLORY
     SEEDS OR BABY HAWAIIAN WOOD ROSE
     SEEDS.

 2. IN 130 CC. OF PETROLEUM ETHER, SOAK
     SEEDS FOR 2 DAYS.
 
 3. FILTER SOLUTION THROUGH TIGHT SCREEN
     THEN THROW AWAY THE LIQUID AND 
     ALLOW THE SEED MUSH TO DRY.
 
 4. FOR ANOTHER 2 DAYS ALLOW THE MUSH TO
     SOAK IN 110 CC. OF WOOD ALCHOL.
 
 5. FILTER THE SOLUTION AGAIN AND SAVING
     THE LIQUID IN A VIAL LABLED "1".
 
 6. REPEAT STEPS 4 AND 5 PUTTIN THE 
     LIQUID IN VIAL "2" AND THROWIN 
  `  AWAY THE MUSH.
 
 7. POUR THE 2 LIQUIDS IN A COOKIE TRAY
     AND ALLOW TO EVAPORATE. WHEN THIS 
     IS DONE SCRAPE OF YELLOW MUCK,THIS
     IS YOUR FINAL PRODUCT.
 
 
MANY COMPANIES POISON THEIR SEEDS SO 
EITHER USE SEEDS U PICKED YOURSELF OR
ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY.

LSD
	Generic name for the hallucinogen lysergic acid
	diethylamide-25.  Discovered by Dr. Albert Hofmann in 1938, LSD is one
	of the most potent mind-altering chemicals known.  A white, odorless
	powder usually taken orally, its effects are highly variable and begin
	within one hour and generally last 8-12 hours, gradually tapering off.
	It has been used experimentally in the treatment of alcoholics and
	psychiatric patients.  [Where it showed some success.] It
	significantly alters perception, mood, and
	psychological processes, and can impair motor coordination and skills.
	During the 1950s and early 1960s, LSD experimentation was legally
	conducted by psychiatrists and others in the health and mental health
	professions.  Sometimes dramatic, unpleasant psychological reactions
	occur, including panic, great confusion, and anxiety.  Strongly
	affected by SET and SETTING.  Classification: hallucinogens.  Slang
	names: acid, sugar.  See also appendix B.  (RIS 27:211-52 entries)

		   available from NIDA or the GPO, page 54.

from the data sheet accompanying product: 
(see also Physician's Desk Reference from mid-60's) 

		      Delysid (LSD 25)

	   D-lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate

	Sugar-coated tablets containing 0.025 mg. (25 ug.)

	Ampoules of 1 ml. containing 0.1  mg.  (100  ug.)  for  oral
administration.

     The solution may also be injected  s.c.  or  i.v.   The
effect  is  identical  with  that of oral administration but
sets in more rapidly.

			 PROPERTIES

     The administration  of  very  small  doses  of  Delysid
(1/2-2  ug./kg.  body  weight) results in transitory distur-
bances of affect, hallucinations, depersonalization,  reliv-
ing  of  repressed memories, and mild neuro-vegetative symp-
toms.  The effect sets in after 30 to 90  minutes  and  gen-
erally  lasts  5 to 12 hours.  However, intermittent distur-
bances of affect may occasionally persist for several days.

		  METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION

     For oral administration the contents of  1  ampoule  of
Delysid  are  diluted with distilled water, a 1% solution of
tartaric acid or halogen-free tap water.

     The absorption of the solution is somewhat  more  rapid
and more constant that that of the tablets.

     Ampoules which have not been opened,  which  have  been
protected  against  light  and  stored  in  a cool place are
stable for an unlimited period.  Ampoules  which  have  been
opened or diluted solutions retain their effectiveness for 1
to 2 days, if stored in a refrigerator.

		   INDICATIONS AND DOSAGE

a)   Analytical  psychotherapy,   to   elicit   release   of
     repressed  material and provide mental relaxation, par-
     ticularly in anxiety states and obsessional neuroses.
     The initial dose is 25 ug. (1/4  of  an  ampoule  or  1
     tablet).   This  dose is increased at each treatment by
     25 ug. until the optimum dose (usually between 50  and
     200  ug.) is found.  The individual treatments are best
     given at intervals of one week.

b)   Experimental studies on the nature  of  psychoses:   By
     taking  Delysid  himself,  the  psychiatrist is able to
     gain an insight in the world of ideas and sensations of
     mental  patients.   Delysid can also be used to induced
     model psychoses of short duration in  normal  subjects,
     this facilitating studies on the pathogenesis of mental
     disease.

     In normal subjects, doses of 25 to 75 ug. are generally
     sufficient  to produce a hallucinatory psychosis (on an
     average 1 ug./kg. body weight).  In  certain  forms  of
     psychosis  and  in chronic alcoholism, higher doses are
     necessary (2 to 4 ug./kg. body weight).

			PRECAUTIONS

     Pathological mental conditions may  be  intensified  by
Delysid.  Particular caution is necessary in subjects with a
suicidal tendency and  in  those  cases  where  a  psychotic
development appears imminent.  The psycho-affective lability
and the tendency to commit impulsive acts  may  occasionally
last for some days.

     Delysid should only be administered under strict  medi-
cal supervision.  The supervision should not be discontinued
until the effects of the drug have completely worn off.

			  ANTIDOTE

     The mental effects of Delysid can be  rapidly  reversed
by the i.m.  administration of 50 mg. chlorpromazine.

Peripheral Actions

These include an oxytocic action and constriction of the blood vessels
of isolated vascular beds.  In intact animals LSD causes a fall in
blood pressure, but its adrenergic blocking potency is low.

LSD causes mydriasis in man and other species.  It also causes
hyperglycaemia and mydriasis, has a hyperthermic action and causes
piloerection.  These effects are sympathetic in nature and are
abolished by ganglion blocking or adrenergic blocking agents.
Parasympathetic effects include salivation, lachyrmation, vomiting,
hypotension, and brachycardia.  Low doses stimulate respiration but
larger doses depress it.

(nb: mydriasis = pupillary dilation)
..............................

Hoffman thought the diethylamide version of the lysergic acid molecule
might be a respiratory stimulant...

..............................

The "speedy" quality of unadulterated LSD is due to the pharmacological
actions of LSD itself, and not necessarily due to decomposition or impurities.
LSD typically causes early adrenergic effects such as sweating, nervousness,
jaw grinding and insomnia which are easily confused with the side effects
of amphetamine.

******************************

ADDICTION POTENTIAL: 

Zero physical addiction potential.  Not something that makes you want to
do it again immediately.  Rarely people use it to escape in a negative
way or as part of "polydrug abuse" behavior or pattern of behavior.

******************************

ADULTERANTS: 

Several problems are associated with street drugs: their unknown
purity and their unknown strength.  Because of its extreme cheapness
and potency, the purity of LSD in blotter form is not an issue: either
it's lsd or untreated paper.  The purity of powders, pills, and liquids
cannot be assumed as safe.  With regards to uncertain strength, the
strength of hits these days is low, 100 micrograms or so.  One should
be careful and assume that the smallest square in a tiling of a sheet
is a dose, even if a printed pattern covers several.  An experienced
person could judge the strength of a dose, and if it is assumed all
doses on a sheet have been processed equivalently, those doses would
be calibrated for others, much like anything else.

..............................

>From _Psychedelic Chemistry_ by M.V.Smith,  2nd edition p 5:

"There is a great deal of superstition regarding purification of
psychedelics.  Actually, any impurities which may be present as a
result of synthetic procedures will almost certainly be without any
effect on the trip.  If there are 200 micrograms of LSD in a tablet,
there could only be 200 mics of impurities present even if the LSD was
originally only 50% pure (assuming nothing else has been added), and
few compounds will produce a significant effect until a hundred to a
thousand times this amount has been ingested.  Even mescaline, which
has a rather specific psychedelic effect, requires about a thousand
thimes this amount."

..............................

Note that: 1) on a piece of paper, vs. a tablet, you can't even add
significant amounts of adulterants 2) adulterants would cost, whereas
blank paper will rip someone off just as well.

LSD itself has some "body-kinks" on some people some times.  nausea is
one of them.  its usually mild and transient.  it also has speedlike
(ie, adrenergic stimulation) effects, etc.

..............................

[Referring to strychnine] 15 mg has been fatal, but a more typical fatal
dose is on the order of 50mg.  [Another post indicates 25 mg. as the LD50] 1
mg of strychnine orally probably has no observable pharmacological effects
in a typical adult.  [1 mg being ten times the effective dose of LSD, by the
way.]


Actually, I think the fact that PharmChem analyzed something on the order of
2,000 LSD samples between 1972 and 1979 and never found one with strychnine
in it would be better.  I'm going over all their data with a toothpick and
I'll get back to you on exactly what I find.  It looks like the percent of
LSD with strychnine in it is, however, at least under .05%.  More a little
later.


..............................

>From "The PharmChem Newsletter" (vol 3, no 3), 1973:

Summary of Street Drug Results - 1973: "Of 189 samples of LSD quantitatively
analyzed, the average dose was 67.25ug LSD.  Of the 32 samples of alleged
mescaline actually containing mescaline, [...stuff about mescaline and
mushrooms deleted...]  It is interesting to note the low incidence of
deception among the less sought after psychotomimetics LSD and PCP."

..............................

This is the PharmChem analysis of LSD from 1972 (vol 1, no 1) up to the time
that the DEA no longer allowed them to make quantitative measurements (1974-
vol 3, no 2 included).  NOTE:  NO STRYCHNINE! also note that PharmChem found
a sample of Shrooms contaminated with Strychnine in 1972 (vol 1, no 7), and
I would think it safe to assume that they also checked LSD for Strychnine.


******************************

BAD TRIPS:

 A person on LSD who becomes depressed, agitated, or confused may
experience these feelings in an overwhelming manner that grows on
itself.  The best solution is to remove disturbing influences, get to
a safe, comforting environment, and reassure the tripper that things
are alright.  It may comfort those who fear that they are losing their
minds to be reminded that it will end in several hours.  

Authorities are fond of administering injections of anti-psychotic
drugs.  Recovery in the presence of authorities, in hospitals or
police stations, is not pleasant.  Sedatives or tranquilizers such as
Valium may help reduce panic and anxiety, but the best solution is
calm talking.  Some claim that niacin (an over the counter vitamin
supplement) can abort a trip, but this may be due to a placebo effect
(niacin produces a flushing effect).

******************************

MYTHS:

LSD does not form "crystals" that reside in the body to be "dislodged"
later, causing flashbacks.  LSD is a crystalline solid (though it is
unlikely that one would ever have enough to be visible to the naked
eye) but it is easily water soluble, thus cannot form bodily
deposits.  Furthermore, it is metabolized and excreted in hours.  The
bogus "loosened crystal" description in not necessary to explain
flashbacks, which are psychological phenomena (see FLASHBACKS).

LSD does not cause chromosome damage.

In Science 30 April 1972, Volume 172 Number 3982 p. 431-440 there was an
article by Norman I. Dishotsky, William D. Loughman, Robert E. Mogar and
Wendell R. Lipscomb titled "LSD and Genetic Damage - Is LSD chromosome 
damaging, carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic?". They reviewed 68 
studies and case reports published 1967-1972, concluding "From our own
work and from a review of literature, we believe that pure LSD ingested
in moderate doses does not damage chromosomes in vivo, does not cause
detectable genetic damage, and is not a teratogen or carcinogen in man."

Well, there's the study by Sidney Cohen which was cited here
recently, Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 130, 1960. The
following is from Jay Stevens' Storming Heaven: "Cohen surveyed a sample
of five thousand individuals who had taken LSD twenty-five thousand
times. He found and average of 1.8 psychotic episodes per thousand
ingestions, 1.2 attempted suicides, and 0.4 completed suicides.
'Considering the enormous scope of the psychic responses it induces,'
he concluded, 'LSD is an astonishingly safe drug.'"


Some urban legends: I've heard two "stories" about people blinding
themselves on "drugs". One was revealed as a hoax by the person who
perpetrated it (apparently it was intended to "illustrate" the dangers
of LSD), another is trotted out by anti-drug speakers at high schools:

1) Seven people on LSD stared at the sun and lost 90% of their reading 
   vision.

2) A teenager arrested while on LSD plucked out his eyeballs in his
   jail cell, and felt no pain.

While these are bogus, the drug has powerful effects on the mind
and the consumer should be aware of the hazards, and act appropriately.

..............................

There is an occasionally circulated fake warning from some police department
about LSD-laced "tattoos" or stickers (the "blue star tattoo" story) being
given to children.  This probably originated with some hick cop or ignorant
and panicky parent not understanding some children-cartoon (eg, mickey mouse
in sorcerer's garb) printed on a sheet of blotter.

..............................

******************************

DANGERS: 

Purely psychological hazards, not harmful to body.  May release latent
psychosis or exacerbate depression, leading to irrational behavior.  There
is also a danger of foolish or incautious behavior, e.g, misjudging
distances or thinking one can fly.  Physical overdose is not a hazard,
though one may easily ingest more than one may be able to handle
psychologically.

..............................

Because the "LSD psychosis" is not distinguishable from non-drug-
induced psychosis, we have reasonable evidence to conclude that LSD
was not the sole cause of psychosis.  Instead, it would seem that the
drug brought on the problems in vulnerable individuals.
Interestingly, the rate of parental alcoholism was found to be much
higher in LSD patients than in other patients or in the general
population by one study (Vardy and Kay, Arch-Gen-Psych, 1983 40(8):
877-83).

..............................

Lethal (toxic) doses of LSD are conservatively several tens of
thousands of times as much as a normal dose, making it (in the toxic
sense) one of the safest drugs known.  See section on Pharmacology for
description of bodily  side-effects.

    The LD50 for psilocybin (active ingredient in mushrooms) is 275 mg/kg
i.v. in mice.  Of course, it would take lots more p.o. to kill someone.

    The reported LD50 values for LSD are 46, 16.5, 0.3 mg/kg I.V. for mice,
rats, and rabbits, respectively.  Again, it's hard to accurately translate
these numbers to oral values.   

Note that an average human dose is 0.001 mg/kg, ie, 1 microgram/kg, ie,
1 part per billion by weight.

FLASHBACKS: 

   Quoted without permission from 'Licit and Illicit Drugs,' written by
Edward M. Brecher and the editors of Consumer Reports. ISBN: 0-316-15340-0

   A simple explanation of LSD flashbacks, and of their changed character
after 1967, is available.  According to this theory, almost everybody
suffers flashbacks with or without LSD.  Any intense emotional
experience--the death of a loved one, the moment of discovery that one is in
love, the moment of an automobile smashup or of a narrow escape from a
smashup--may subsequently and unexpectedly return vividly to consciousness
weeks or months later.  Since the LSD trip is often an intense emotional
experience, it is hardly surprising that it may similarly "flash back."

******************************

INSOMNIA:

Insomnia occurs frequently after the trip.  A mild, over-the-counter
sleeping aid can help, and these antihistamines do not produce adverse
interactions.  Also, some people like to consume a small amount of alcoholic
beverage to "smooth the jitteries".  The usual precautions about sleeping
aids if alcohol has been consumed apply of course.


******************************

TOLERANCE: 

Aquired rapidly, within 3 days.  Tolerance dissipates equally rapidly,
without withdrawal, craving, or symptoms of addiction.

Cross-tolerance can and is developed between other indole hallucinogens, eg,
DMT, LSD and Psilocybin.

"The main constituent of the seeds of Rivea corymbosa is ergine or d-lysergic
acid amide. Minor alkaloids present are the related d-isolysergic acid amide
(isoergine), chanoclavine, elymoclavine and lysergol. The seeds of Ipomoea
violacea have a similar composition, but instead of lysergol, they have
ergometrine (ergonovine). Later, very minor amounts of two alkaloids
ergometrinine and penniclavine - were found in I. violacea by chromatography.
the total alkaloid content of the seeds of Ipomoea viloacea is approximately
five times as great as that of the seeds of Rivea corymbosa: 0.06% in the
former; 0.012% in the latter. This difference in the alkaloid content
explains why Indians employ smaller doses of seeds of the Ipomoea than of the
Rivea.

ANTHROPOLOGY: 


_The Road to Eleusius_ by Hoffman, Wasson, and Ruck.

Summary: A secret religion existed for 2,000 years in Greece (until
the christians displaced it around 400 AD).  The initiation was open
to anyone who spoke Greek and hadn't committed murder, once in their
life.  After 6 month long preparatory rituals, members walked to
Eleusius whereupon they underwent secret rituals.  The rituals
remained secret until the 1970's.

Wasson, an ethnomycological scholar and former banker (and the first
white to trip on shrooms with the mexican indians) proposed the
following explanation of the Eleusian mysteries to Hoffman, an
ergot-alkaloid expert chemist, and Ruck, a greek scholar:

The Secret of the ritual involved the personal visions induced by
drinking the grain decoction administered to the initiates.  The
domestication of grains permitted the development of greek
civilization; it also brought ergot fungus (of St. Anthony's fire
infamy).

The thin book contains their argument for the use of the ergot fungus
in Eleusian rites, Wasson providing some background on the use of
mushrooms and grains and their role in the culture; Hoffman on the
psychoactivity of ergot strains; and Ruck on the mythological and
cultural backround of the sect.

Evidence includes: Hoffman dosed himself with large (ergot-derived)
doses of obstetric compounds to assay their hallucinogenic potential,
and found them to possess such activity.  The Eleusian temple site still
remains, but there is no room to view theatric performances, just rows of
tripping initiates, further supporting their argument.

An interesting read, and its neat to think that the culture that
more or less lead to the western industrial one had psychedelic rites.
(Various greek prominant figures attended the rituals, including Plato).

IPOMOEA PURPUREA: A NATURALLY OCCURRING PSYCHEDELIC

Charles Savage, Willis W. Harman and James Fadiman

>From  "Altered States of Consciousness, A Book of Readings"
       edited by Charles Tart   BF311.T28

Of the naturally occurring plant alkaloids used in ancient and modern
religious rites and divination one of the least studied is ololiuqui. The
earliest known description of its use is by Hernandez, the King of Spain's
personal physician, who spent a number of years in Mexico studying the
medicinal plants of the Indians and "accurately illustrated ololiuqui as a
morning glory in his work which was not published until 1651" (Schultes,
1960). In his words, "When a person takes ololiuqui, in a short time he loses
clear reasoning because of the strength of the seed, and he believes he is in
communion with the devil" (Alacon, 1945). Schultes (1941) and Wasson (1961)
have reported in detail on the religious and divinatory use of two kinds of
morning-glory seeds, Rivea corymbosa and Ipomoea violacea, among the Mazatec
and Zapotec indians. The first of these is assumed to be the ololiuqui of the
ancient Aztecs.

In 1955 Osmond described personal experiments with Rivea corymbosa seeds and
reported that the effects were similar to those of d-lysergic acid
diethylamide (LSD-25). He suggested (1957) that the word psychedelic (meaning
mind-manifesting) be used as a generic term for this class of substances to
refer to their consciousness-expanding and psychotherapeutic function as
contrasted  with the hallucinogenic aspect. In 1960 Hoffman reported that he
had isolated d-lysergic acid amide (LA) and d-isolysergic acid amide from the
seed of both Rivea corymbosa and Ipomoea violacea. LA is very similar to LSD
in its psychological and physiological manifestations but is reported to have
about one twentieth the psychological effectiveness of LSD (Cerletti &
Doepfner, 1958).

The work of these investigators led us to a preliminary study of the
psychedelic properties of species of Ipomoea which are commonly found within
the continental United States. The seeds of Ipomoea purpurea, the common
climbing morning glory, resemble the seeds of Ipomoea violacea and have been
found to have similar psychedelic properties. Recent analysis by Taber et al.
(1963) has verified that LA is present in the varieties used and is probably
the primary active agent.

The effects of the seeds of Ipomoea purpurea (varieties Heavenly Blue and
Pearly Gates) in a total of 45 cases are summarized below. The subjects are
all normally functioning adults and the majority had previous experience with
LSD. The onset of effects is about half an hour after the seeds have been
chewed and swallowed and they last from five to eight hours.


	       Low Dose, 20-50 Seeds (11 Subjects)

This dosage rarely produces any visual distortions, although with eyes
closed there may be beginning imagery. Restlessness, evidenced by alternating
periods of pacing about and lying down, may be present. There tends to be a
heightened awareness of objects and of nature, and enhanced rapport with
other persons. A feeling of emotional clarity and of relaxation is likely to
persist for several hours after other effects are no longer noticeable.

	      Medium Dose, 100-150 Seeds (22 Subjects)

In this range the effects resemble those reported for medium-dose (75-150
micrograms) LSD experiences, including spatial distortions, visual and
auditory hallucinations, intense imagery with eyes closed, synaesthesia and
mood elevation. These effects, which occur mainly during the period of 1 to 4
hours after ingestion, are typically followed by a period of alert calmness
which may last until the subject goes to sleep.

	      High Dose, 200-500 Seeds (12 Subjects)

In this range the first few hours may resemble the medium-dose effects
described above. However, there is usually a period during which the
subjective states are of a sort not describable in terms of images or
distortions, states characterized by loss of ego boundaries coupled with
feelings of euphoria and philosophical insight. These seem to parallel the
published descriptions of experiences with high doses (200-500 micrograms) of
LSD given in a supportive, therapeutic setting as reported by Sherwood et al.
(1962).

All the subjects who had previous experience with LSD claimed the effects of
the seeds were similar to those of LSD. Transient nausea was the most
commonly reported side effect, beginning about one half hour after ingestion
and lasting a few minutes to several hours. Other reported side effects not
commonly found with LSD were a drowsiness or torpor (possibly due to a
glucoside also present in the seeds) and a coldness in the extremities
suggesting that the ergine content of the seeds may be causing some vascular
constriction. (If this is the case, there may be some danger of ergot
poisoning resulting from excessive dosages of the seeds.) The only untoward
psychic effect was a prolonged (eight hours) disassociative reaction which
was terminate with chlorpromazine [Thorazine]. The possibility of prolonged
adverse reactions to the psychological effects of the seeds is essentially
the same as with LSD, and the same precautions should be observed (Cohen &
Ditman, 1963).

..............................

IPOMOEA.003   7-MAY-90

Additional Notes:
Ipomoea purpurea is sold as the "Heavenly Blue" variety of morning glory.
"Ipomoea tricolor" is the trade name used for that variety. It is identical
with the species of morning glory described above.

The seeds must be chewed or ground in order to be effective. Soaking the
ground seeds in water for several hours, filtering out the grounds,
and then drinking only the water portion of the mixture can reduce
some of the stomach-upset symptoms if such occur.

Unpleasant LSD and morning glory trips can be smoothed out or even
stopped by taking niacin (in the form of nicotinic acid, vitamin B-3 or
"niacin"). Vitamin C has been shown to reduce the incidence of paranoia and
prevent depletion of the vitamin from the adrenal glands during LSD trips.

There have been reports that commercially available packets of morning
glory seeds from some distributors are coated with fungicides or
other chemicals to increase shelf life or discourage the practice
of eating them. Seeds from plants grown in one's own garden will
be safe as long as you do not spray them with insecticides.

The last few notes about Niacin and Vitamin C are based on
a paperback edition of Hoffer & Osmonds "The Psychedelics"

It's pretty clear that the latin names of this plant are somewhat
confused (which is typical). Ipomoea purpurea, Ipomoea tricolor,
Ipomoea violacea and Ipomoea rubro-caerulea are all the same plant.

The other variety of morning glory, "Ololiuhqui" has at least two
Latin names as well: Rivea corymbosa, and Turbina corymbosa.

"Recreational use of Ergoline Alkaloids from Argyreia Nervosa"
William E. Shawcross  
Journal of Psychedelic Drugs Vol. 15(4) Oct-Dec 1983

CHEMISTRY AND EFFECT OF THE SEEDS
The Hawaiian baby woodrose entered the drug scene in 1965 with the
publication of a paper in "Science" entitled "Ergoline Alkaloids in Tropical
Wood Roses" by Hylin and Watson. The wide circulation of this journal assured
thorough dissemination of the information they presented. They wrote, "The
possible health and legal problems associated with the presence of similar
compounds in commercially cultivated plants led us to examine the ornamental
wood roses, Ipomoea tuberosa and Argyreia nervosa, both common Hawaiian crops
that have assumed commerical importance as components of [the] dried tropical
flower industry." Comparing the seeds of these two plants with those of the
morning glory varieties Pearly Gates and Heavenly Blue, they found the
following yield of alkaloids (mg of alkaloid/g of seed material):

     Heavenly Blue        0.813
     Pearly Gates         0.423
     I. tuberosa          [None]
     A. nervosa           3.050

The seed of A. nervosa is the best plant source of ergoline alkaloids
discovered; it contains approximately 3 mg of alkaloidal material per gram of
seed. Approximately one-eighth of this is lysergamide. 

Hylin and Watson found the major alkaloidal constituents in A. nervosa seeds to
be ergine (780 mcg/g of fresh seed) and isoergine and penniclavine (555 mcg).

[Note: Argyreia nervosa has NO history of shamanic use as a hallucinogen]

This is an excerpt from the article cited.
There's no record of Argyreia being used as an hallucinogen in
India, but it was used externally as some kind of skin medicine.
There's been speculation that Argyreia might have been a component
of "Soma", but there's no evidence for that, apparently.
Because there's not a long history of human usage of Argyreia,
it may be that there are glycosides not mentioned here that
take effect at higher doses or might cause stomach upset, tachycardia
etc. The article mentioned intestinal complaints in one or two
cases at higher experimental doses.

Ergot is a product of the fungus Claviceps purpurea.  The bio-active
ingredients of ergot are all derivatives of lysergic acid.  LSD is a
semisynthetic derivative of lysergic acid.  Thus LSD is an
"ergot"-like substance.

******************************


MECHANISM OF ACTION: 

(Note: the mechanism of action of LSD and other psychedelics is uncertain.)

>From a chapter titled Hallucinogens and Other Psychotomimetics: Biological
Mechanisms by S.J.Watson

"The current thesis of the effect of indole hallucinogens on
5-hydroxytrypamine might be stated as follows: LSD acts to preferentially
inhibit serotonergic cell firing and seems to spare postsynaptic serotnergic
receptors.  This preference is shared by other simillar hallucinogens but in
a limited fashion.  Nonhallucinogenic analogs of LSD show no preference.
These results suggest that there are two different steric conformation of
serotonergic receptors, one of which has higher affinity for LSD than the
other.  In general, 5-ht is an inhibitory transmitter; thus, when its
activity is decreased, the next neuron in the chain is freed from inhibition
and becomes more active.  Since serotnergic systems appear to be intimately
involved int eh control of sensation, sleep, attention, and mood, it may be
possible to explain the actions of LSD and other hallucinogens by their
disinhibition of these critical systems.

There is also evidence for interaction with dopaminergic systems.

..............................

LSD acts as a 5HT autoreceptor agonist in the raphe nucleus.  These
autoreceptors are typically considered to be 5HT1As.  It also acts as a 5HT2
agonist, which is thought to be the main site of hallucinogenic activity.
It's probably best called a a mixed 5HT2/5HT1 receptor partial agonist.

I don't know of its effects on dopamine.  Wouldn't be surprised if it has
'em; the systems aren't really functionally separable.  The DA effects
wouldn't be necessary for hallucinogenic activity, I'd bet.

..............................

******************************

RELATED COMPOUNDS:



Related compounds are the indole hallucinogens including DMT
(dimethyl-tryptamine), DET (diethyl-), etc.; psilocybin; lysergic acid.  DMT
is very fast acting, lasting less than an hour.  Psilocybin, found in
hallucinogenic (aka magic or mexican) mushrooms, has effects similar to LSD
but they work for approximately half the duration.  These are all indole
derivatives like the neurotransmitter serotonin, 5-hydroxy-tryptamine.
"Indole" is the name of the 6-carbon ring attached to the 5-ring containing
a nitrogen. The lysergic acid molecule contains an indole structure plus
additional rings.

LSD's two ethyl groups hanging off the amine may be replaced with
other carbon chains for compounds with different durations, potencies,
and effects.  

While LSD is semi-synthetic, DMT and psilocybin are found in nature.
See the sections on BOTANY and ANTHROPOLOGY for info on related
natural (plant) compounds and their uses.

..............................

   1) DMT, DET, psylocin, psylocybin, : The mushroom psylocybin cubensis
contains all four of these indole derivatives, as well as others. DMT is
dimethyltryptamine, an indole derivative which has functionalized at the 3
position with the dimethyl ethylamine group.  It is a close relative to the
amino acid, tryptophan, which until recently was available in bulk at
vitamin shops, until some jerk poisoned himself by taking a wonga dose of
it. [Actually it may have been a single toxic batch mistakenly produced in
Japan.] A prep came out in 1984 for LSD using l--tryptophan as the
precursor, so this may have facilitated the government's pullin it from the
shelves. I can't find tryptophan anywhere, now, and I've tried, bud.
     DMT, and it's brother DET (diethyltryptamine), have no oral activity,
so have to be smoked. They stink like fish oil when lit, though. Both have
hallucinogenic effects within 2-3 minutes of toking, wand while DMT lasts
for only a half hour, DET is a smoother, more euphoric high, lasting twice
as long. DET has effects similar to psylocybin.
     Psylocybin is DMT which has a functional group, phosphoryloxy-, at the
4 position on the indole ring. This group is immediately converted to
hydroxyl- as soon as the stuff hits your stomach to give the cousin,
psylocin. In preparing the drug, then, it is not necessary to proceed beyond
the psylocin.
     DMT and DET are easily derived from many indole derivatives, the
easiest of which is indole-3-acetic acid. I've done this reaction and it
stinks to high heaven of indole gunge, skatoles (methylindoles), and
indenes. Bad news if you want to make it at home, because the stench is
pervasive. Other derivatives, using phenyl or butyl groups have been
reported as having oral activity, so it is not necessary to smoke the stuff.
Doses run at about a hundred mgs for smoked drug, while psylocin is orally
active at about 5 mgs.
     For a good reference work on these compounds, their preps, and effects,
see Michael Valentine Smith's "Psychedelic Chemistry," publisher unknown.

MANUFACTURE:

Forget it.  Precursors (ergot alkaloids, used medicinally for migraines and
ob/gyn due to their vasoconstrictive effects) are closely watched.  (They
are obtained through commercially cultured ergot fungus; one could
theoretically extract lsyergic amides from morning glory or Hawaiian wood
rose seeds.)  (Though there are routes to synthesize lysergic acid from
"scratch", these are complicated also.)  Other typically needed chemicals
are very dangerous.  Serious experience in organic chemistry lab would be
necessary.  If you have to ask where to find the recipes, you don't know
enough about chemistry to try it.  (For the curious: the _Anarchists
Cookbook_ is a bad place to start.  _Psychedelic Chemistry_ is better, the
patent office or chem. lit. better.)  And you'll probably trip during
manufacture if you actually succeed.  Its easier and safer to buy it on the
black market.


******************************

DRUG TESTING: 

No risk.  Its not looked for,  hard to find, and transient.

..............................


"A maximum concentration of 2-8 ng/ml [Plasma concentration of LSD]
 was reached 1.0-1.25 h after an oral dose of 160 ug.
 ...[A] value of 2.9 h for the elimination half-life of LSD from
 plasma [was reached].
	[Upshall, D.G., Wailling, D.G.: The determination of LSD in
	 human plasma following oral administration.
	 Clinica Chimica Acta 36, 67-73 (1972)]

Second of all, LSD and its metabolites are detectable in the urine
for much longer than one hour.

"LSD and its metabolites were still detectable in human urine for
 as long as 4 days after the ingestion of 0.2 mg of the drug.
	[Faed, E.M., McLeod, W.R.: A urine screening test of lysergide.
	 Journal of Chromatographic Science.  11, 4-6 (1973)]

Note that standard, cheap initial drug screening does not use
chromatography or mass-spectrometry, and does not look for LSD.

..............................

Spinal taps are not particularly useful (cerebro-spinal fluid doesn't
concentrate LSD or metabolites) and are never done under any
circumstances: they are painful and dangerous.

..............................


You might want to mention that Abbie Hoffman's _Steal This Urine Test_
has a table which claims lsd is detectable for 40 days. I'm almost sure
this was a typo.

..............................


> 1] How long can LSD be detected in the body?

This varies by the test being used, the detection limit placed on the test,
the point of collection and type of the sample fluid, the amount of LSD that
was taken, and the individual in question.

Assuming the testers are using an RIA screening test with the cutoff set at
0.1 ng/ml and assuming that the user has recently emptied their bladder,
then the detection limit for one hit (100 ug) is normally around 30 hours.
Each doubling of the initial amount will add about 5 hours.  Thus taking 8
hits will leave a user vulnerable for approximately 2 days.  (NOTE: This is
based on the data in [7])

> 2] What exact form of test can be used to detect LSD in the body?  There
are a number of tests which can be used to detect LSD in the body.

Abuscreen, a product of Roche Diagnostic Systems, is a series of
RadioImmunoAssay (RIA) tests, one of which is used to detect LSD and its
metabolites in whole blood, serum (blood), urine and stomach contents [1].
RIA can in theory be used to detect quantities as small as 0.020 nanograms
(ng) per milliliter (ml) of sample [2].  Laboratory tests have shown that
RIA results are accurate down to at least 0.1 ng/ml [3].  The manufacturer
recommends limiting the cutoff to 0.5 ng/ml.

EMIT, a product of Syva Corporation, is another series of tests, one of
which can be used to detect LSD and its metabolites in serum and urine.
EMIT stands for Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique.

Both EMIT and Abuscreen are "positive/negative" response tests (much like
pregnancy tests) which require periodic equipment calibration and consume
chemicals for each test performed.  A basic battery of tests costs approx.
$15-$25 per person [4].  The basic tests (recommended by NIDA) include
marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, and phencyclidine (PCP).
Normally, unless an (employer) specifically requests the test, an LSD assay
is not run.

Both Roche and Syva recommend confirmation of positive results by using a
different test.  The usual method of confirming positive results is some
form of chromatography.  These include High Performance Thin Layer
Chromatography (HPTLC)[3], and different forms of Gas Chromatography/Mass
Spectrometry (GC/MS)[5][6][7][8][9].  HPTLC and GC/MS can be used to give
quantitative results as opposed to the Boolean results from EMIT or
Abuscreen.  Laboratory tests have shown that GC/MS test for LSD in urine[6]
and blood[7] can be accurate down to 0.1 ng/ml.  The cost for confirmation
of a positive screening test is approximately $50-60.

Positive results to either EMIT and RIA are held to be "probable cause" by
U.S. courts.  GC/MS results are held to be "proof" by U.S. courts.

> I am asking for an actual text message containing a short, precise >
description of each test,

Immunoassays chemicals are created by injecting animals (rabbits, sheep,
donkey, etc) with the drug to be tested for and an albumin which force the
animal to produce antibodies.  The antibodies are then removed from the
animal, purified and bottled.  In RIA tests, the antibodies are then added
to the fluid sample with a radioactively labeled chemical.  Any of the drug
(or similar chemicals) found in a sample that is being tested will react
with this glop and by measuring the radioactivity, the amount of drugs can
be determined [2][10].

> 3] How can such a test be beaten?

While there is some literature on adulterating urine samples to produce
false negative results [11], there has been little written that applies
specifically to the LSD screening tests.

I would suggest you read the article posted by Paul Hager paying particular
attention to the warning about water intoxication [12]:

The immunsoassay tests vary in their specificity.  Some display a relatively
low cross-reactivity[13], others a high cross-reactivity[14].  The exact
metabolites of LSD in humans have not been fully determined yet, though
animal studies have been done.  The only verified human metabolite I could
find in the literature was N-demethyl-LSD[6] but I did not check all the
references.

Sorry this was so long but I thought it deserved it :-)
Enjoy a "referenced" article.

There were rumors going around that LSD could be detected
by drug tests fo thirty days.  I think this reference and
abstract makes it clear that it is probably 4 days, max.

 ABSTRACT  Demethylation of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in the human has
	   been demonstrated, both in vitro and in vivo, and aromatic
	   hydroxylation at positions 13 and 14 has been tentatively
	   identified. A gas chromatography/resonance electron capture
	   ionization mass spectrometry (GC/MS) assay for LSD and
	   N-demethyl-LSD in urine has been developed, in which the drug and
	   its metabolite are converted to their N-tri-fluoroacetyl derivatives
	   prior to GC/MS analysis. Linear and reproducible calibration curves
	   have been obtained for LSD concentrations from 0.05 to 5.0 ng/mL,
	   and for N-demethyl-LSD concentrations from 0.03 to 5.0 ng/mL. The
	   assay was used to determine the urinary concentrations of LSD and
	   N-demethyl-LSD following administration of a single oral dose of the
	   drug (1 mu g/kg) to an adult volunteer. The rates of excretion of
	   LSD and N-demethyl-LSD reached maxima in urine collected at time
	   intervals of 4-6 and 8-10 h after administration, respectively. The
	   elimination half-lives for LSD and N-demethyl-LSD were 3.6 and 10.0
	   h, respectively

******************************

LEGAL SCHEDULING: 

Class I, "no medical use" --- mostly for political reasons, as it was
and is used in psychotherapy.  (Current use is in Switzerland.)


******************************

SET and SETTING: 

"SET" is the expectations a person brings with them.  "Setting" is the
environment that a person is in.  Set includes expectations about the
drug's actions and how the person will react.  Setting includes the
social and physical conditions.  For LSD and the hallucinogen-type
drug more than other psychoactives, set and setting are very important
in determining the nature of the experience.  These factors make the
difference between, e.g., the experiences of someone taking the drug
for enhancement at a concert, for psychotherapy in an doctor's office,
in a religious context, or in the outdoors for an aesthetic
experience.  For best results, one should take LSD only with people
one trusts in safe, comfortable surroundings, free of everyday
intrusions.  Tripping alone is a very risky thing to do, that
inexperienced people should avoid.

******************************

STORAGE: 

First, note that LSD is a fairly stable organic molecule, no more or
less fragile than other molecules with comparable structures.

The main factors to be concerned with are moisture (due to leaching
and facilitated chemical reactions in the presense of moisture),
oxygen, light, and temperature.  Reaction rates typically depend upon
temperature exponentially.  These factors basically apply to all
organic compounds.

Sealing in AL foil in a cool dark place is fine.  Some recommend
refrigeration, but be careful about nosy guests, condensation, and frost.
Multiple, redundant seals are suggested, eg., paper in metal foil in
plastic in a metal candy tin which has been taped shut.  Should last
at least a presidential term.

Wallets are contraindicated as storage locations due to sweat.

******************************

SYNERGIES, BAD COMBINATIONS:

Smoking cannabis products considerably increases the effects,
increasing the visuals and also possibly increasing the cognitive and
linguistic disorders.  As the effects of LSD wear off, marijuana may
bring them back, and also ease the jitteriness some dislike.  Nitrous
oxide goes well with LSD, though one should be extra careful (not to
suffocate or fall down) with the nitrous because of the effects of the
LSD.  MDA & cousins can go well, but people on these drugs should not
take LSD unless they are familiar with the latter's effects.

Alcohol's effects are largely overwhelmed by LSD, and they act in opposite
ways: alcohol being a depressant and LSD being a (hyper)stimulant.
Generally mixing stimulants and sedatives is counterproductive.

MAO inhibitors ??? 
Amphetamines and cocaine ???

******************************

SYNTHESIS: 

Don't try it, too difficult and risky both physically and
legally.  Precursor medical drugs (ob/gyn and migraine ergot
alkaloids) are watched.
