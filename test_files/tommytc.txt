"Tommy The Cat" by Primus

"I remember it as though it were a meal ago," said Tommy the Cat
as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter that may have nestled 
it's way into his mighty throat.  Many a fat alley rat had met it's demise
while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of this awesome prowling 
machine.  Truly a wonder of nature, this urban predator.  Tommy the cat
had many a story to tell.  But it was a rare occaision, such as this, that
he did.

"She came sliding on down the alley way like butter dripping off a hot 
biscuit.  The aroma. The mean scent was enough to arouse suspition in even
the oldest of the tigers that hung around the hot spots in those days.
The sight was beyond belief.  Many a head snapped for double, even triple 
takes as the vivacious feline made her way into the delta at the alley way
where the most feared young tabbys were known to hang out.  They hung out 
in droves.  Such a multitude of masculinity could only be found in one place
and that was O'Malley's Alley."

"The air was thick with cat calls. (No pun intended).  But not even did 
twitch as she sauntered strait into the heart of the alley way.  She
knew what she wanted.  She was looking for that stud bull.  The he-cat.
That was me.  Tommy The Cat is my name and I say unto thee..."

"Say baby, do you want to lay down with me?  Say baby, do you want to lay 
down by my side? Baby, do you want to lay down with me? Say, baby?
Say, baby?"
