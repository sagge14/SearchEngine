Herewith yet another SCAdian song.....


        BLACK LEATHER DOUBLET
                -Ioseph of Locksley
        (c) copyright 1991 W.J.Bethancourt III
        (Tune: "Black Denim Trousers")

 CHORUS: He wore a black leather doublet, and great big floppy boots
         And black leather gauntlets edged in needlework and lace
         His hat was brave with feathers, his curls a master-touch
         You could tell he was a Cavalier...but you couldn't tell him much!

 His beard was trimmed quite neatly, he wore perfume in his hair
 And underneath his leather he wore silken underwear!
 He was all lace and feathers, with diamonds in his ear,
 His clothing was the envy of the local Cavaliers!

 He buckled and he swashed and his Attitude was grand
 He held the ladies of his Shire in the hollow of his hand
 His wit it was astounding, he was quick with repartee
 And serenaded all the Court with lovely roundelays

 A lady could not cross the street with a puddle in her way
 Our hero ran up boldly, and quickly saved the day
 With a cloak from someone else's back, he covered up the wet
 And walked the lady cross the street as quick as you can bet!

 I'm afraid he wasn't listening to the cry of "Hold, M'Lord!"
 And he didn't hear the growling of the evil demon Ford
 For there came a redneck pickup that was California bound
 And when the dust had cleared, all they found

 CHORUS: Were his black leather doublet, and great big floppy boots
         And black leather gauntlets edged in needlework and lace
         They found his hat and feathers, and lacy cuffs and such
         You could tell he was a Cavalier...but you couldn't tell him much!


                        *


Verse 3 echoes the old saw "An Elizabethan uses his own cloak to cover
the puddle .... but a true Cavalier uses -someone else's- cloak ...."
