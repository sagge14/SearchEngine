                             PREFACE





In September 1986, the California Department of Alcohol and Drug
Programs (ADP) formally sponsored initiation of the Drug Abuse
Information and Monitoring Project (DAIMP).  One of the primary
objectives of this project is to conduct ethnographic and
epidemiological research in order to provide information on the
new and changing conditions in drug abuse.  Another key objective
of the project is to provide an assessment of state needs and
resources to deal with the treatment and prevention of drug
abuse.  As a third objective, DAIMP will produce a series of
monographs focusing on specific issues in drug abuse that are
useful to California's drug program network.

The continuing problem of drug abuse has been recently compounded
by several developments.  These include the increasing amounts of
illicit drugs (e.g., heroin and cocaine) being imported into the
U.S., by an increasing number of routes, and the appearance of
new and different drugs.  The abuse potential of these newer
drugs has not yet been ascertained.  California is especially
affected by these developments.

The use of drugs such as MDMA has increased since their
introduction on the street in the early 1970's.  Only due to
recent mass media interest has the public become aware of these
drugs.  While some therapists have portrayed the drug MDMA as a
therapeutic tool, those in the drug treatment network are
concerned about its abuse potential. Thus, there is a
polarization of opinion regarding MDMA and similar drugs.  Much
of the current knowledge about MDMA is limited as it relies upon
anecdotal sources.

As part of the DAIMP series, this first monograph presents
information about MDMA.  It is intended to inform the public and
those in the field who must learn about these newer drugs and
their unique effects.  As part of continuing research on drug
abuse the current monograph represents an important contribution
to the understanding of a much publicized drug and its potential
for abuse.
