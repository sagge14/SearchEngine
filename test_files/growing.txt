    An interesting subject that they don't teach in school is Horticulture.
Everyone, most likely has once in their life tried some 'Pot'.` It sure can be
a different experience.  One big problems with smoking 'Pot' is that it can
get to be very expensive.  This problem can be easily solved, by growing it
yourself.
 
First lets discuss the plant a little more.  The plant is Cannabis: the weed
we know as the marIjuana or bemp plant.  T`roughout recorded history, it has
been with us.  But only in the past fifty years has all the fuss been kicked
up about it.  Marijuana has been used as food, fiber, and medicine.  Monks
in the Middle Ages used the seeds for porridge, early American settlers wove
it into fabric, and for centuries folk medcine extolled its virtues.
In 1970, former president RIchard Nixon convinced Congress to pass the Federal
Controlled Substance Act, a complete overhaul of the nations drug laws.
This resulted in Marijuana being classified in 'Schedule 1' along with heroin.
States have since then reformed their laws, and about 10 states have stopped
arresting marijuana smokers.  In Alaska it is legal to smoke 'Pot' in the
privacy of your own home (Only for Adults).
 
Some of the best grass in the world is grown right here in the United States.
You can do it too, it's not difficult to do.   Highly potent plants can be
grown indoors, as well as in gardens, fields, and the wilds.  Indoor growers
must create an environment, whereas outdoor gardners work within the
environment.
Modest indoor gardens are quite simple to set up and care for.  All materials
you'll need are available at nurseries, garden shops, and hardware and light-
ing stores, or they may be found around the house or street.  The cost will
depend on how large and elaborate you make the garden and on wheather you buy
or scavenge materials.  With a little ingenuity, the cost can be negligible.
 
Outdoors, a small  patch in your summer garden can be supply all your smoking
needs with little or no expense.  Generally marijuana requires less care than
most other crops, because of its natural tenacity and ability to compete with
indigenous weeds.  Hardy Cannabis resists mild frost, extreme heat, deluge,
and drought.  In this country, few deseases attack marijuana; once the plants
are growing, they develop their own natural protection against most insects.
 
In some areas of the country, such as parts of the midwest and east, the plant
may require no more attention than sowing the seeds in spring and harvesting
the plant in autumn.   Naturing and watching these beautiful plants as they
respond can be a humanizing experience.
 
One note should be made for outdoor growers, be careful and keep your plants
in a secure place, otherwise it might result in theft of the plant andoor
possible legal consiquences.
 
Part II will deal with indoor growing, whereas
Part III will go further in debt with outside gardens.
 
I thank The Ferret for contributing to this text and my fellow 'burnouts'
