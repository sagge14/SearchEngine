Here's the current version of my Ferris-file -- it ought to answer all
your questions.

FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF -- The Soundtrack             updated 25 October 1991

      compiled by Lazlo Nibble (Ernie Longmire) -- lazlo@triton.unm.edu
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There was never a soundtrack album released from the film FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY
OFF, because director John Hughes didn't think that the diverse range of
styles of songs in the movie would "work" on one album.  The closest that
they got to putting out a soundtrack was a promotional single with a couple
of tracks from the movie; it was distributed at sneak previews and the
like.  (Dunno what's on it.)

This listing's designed to help people find all the songs used in the movie
so they can compile their own soundtrack tape.  If you have information not
included here, please send it to me.  Maybe someday some enterprising
bootlegger will pull these all together and release one of their own (hint
hint).
