BAMBOO by Tom Rogers and Ellen Fuller
 
You take some auto workers
You take some auto workers
You take some auto workers
And don't allow a union
 
     Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh Honda
 
My owner's cross the water
My owner's cross the water
My owner's cross the water
And buying up Hawaii
 
     Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh Honda
 
Iacocca, Iacocca.  He fell down.
Iacocca, Iacocca.  He fell down.
 
We make your Ford Escort
We make your Chevy Geo
We make your Dodge Shadow
It's just a Mitsubishi
 
     Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh Honda
 
THIS LAND WAS MADE BY JAPANESE (by Karyn
            Klausner, Bob Hirschfeld, Kate
            McCaffrey, Jane Rein'l)
(to the tune of This Land is Your Land)
 
This land is your land, this land is my land
As long this land, is made in Thailand
We don't need quotas, for more Toyotas
This land was made by Japanese.
 
As I was driving that superhighway
Ten thousand imports were going my way
Paid for enjoyment, with unemployment
This land was made by Japanese.
 
Since Hiroshima and Nagasaki
Our relations have been less rocky
They don't remember Seven December
This land was made by Japanese.
 
They learned our methods, but something's
            rotten
They practiced virtues we have forgotten
They call our workers, illit'rate shirkers
This land was made by Japanese.
 
We bought their cameras, transistor radios
And then their TV's, cars and stereos,
But they won't buy goods made in the U.S.
This land was made by Japanese.
 
They never looked for the union label
They claimed their workers were all more able
Negotiations?  They own the table.
This land was made by Japanese.
 
But in their haste to buy our country
They bought cholest'rol, and shortened life
            spans
They bought heart failure, and increased
            cancer
We're paying back the Japanese
 
This land is your land, this land is my land
As long this land, is made in Thailand
We don't need quotas, for more Toyotas
This land was made by Japanese.
