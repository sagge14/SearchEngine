YOU WILL NEED:- 
  
Ammonium Nitrate (get a good grade, it is fertilizer and comes is 50 lb. bags,
also available from laboratory supply companies such as VW&R or American 
Scientific at considerably greater cost.) 

Clean Sand, fairly fine grained, 30 mesh or finer.  If you collect your own, 
and you get fresh water sand, (rivers and streams), it will be necessary to 
wash it thoroughly with water and then dry is before using.  You may also re- 
use sand that has been used to make nitrous oxide by washing it before re- 
using it. 
  
Electric hot plate, 500 W to 2500 W, WITH VAIRABLE HEAT. 
  
Stainless steel dial thermometer [this is the only "metal" device which may be
used] that goes to 250 C (450 F). Select the Erlenmeyer flask (next item) and 
th thermometer so that the thermometer can reach at least to within 1/16" of 
the bottom of the flask through the flask stopper (see below). 
  
A 2000 to 4000 ml PYREX or KIMAX Erlenmeyer Flask. 
  
Several feet of 3/8" clear vinyl or surgical ruber tubing. 
  
At least 4 8mm I.D. glass or plastic tubing "T"'s. 
  
1 120 degree bend 8mm I.D. PYREX GLASS elbow, with about 3" of tubing on each 
side of the bend. 
  
7 6-8" long pieces of 8mm I.D. glass or plastic tubing. 
  
3 6-8 feet long 1.5" to 2" diam glass or clear plastic pipes. 
  
1 two hole rubber or neoprene stopper to fit the top of the Erlenlmeyer flask.
One hole should fit the 8mm I.D. PYREX GLASS elbow, and the other hole should 
fit the stainless steel dial thermometer. 
  
6 one hole rubber or neoprene stoppers that will fit the ends of the clear 
plastic or glass pipes.  The holes in the stoppers must fit the straight 8mm 
I.D. glass or plastic tubes. 
  
Some super strength plastic trash bags, and some rubber bands. 
  
  
THE CHEMISTRY:- 
  
          NH4NO3 -------------------->   N2O   +   2H2O 
                    210 C  (410 F) 
  
        ammonium    gently heated      nitrous  +   two 
        nitrate                         oxide      water 
  
  
THE SET-UP:- 
  
     If you've gotten this far, let me re-emphasize the importance of meeting 
the quality specifications of the equipment list.  If you're serious enough to
go for N2O, you'll want a good setup you can use a long time and enjoy the 
LAUGHING GAS without worrying about the generating system blasting you to 
kingdom come.

ASSEMBLY:- 
  
     NOTE: hen inserting tubing through stopper holes, ALWAYS WRAP AND HOLD 
THE TUBING WITH A CLOTH.  Also moisten the tip of the tubing and the stopper 
hole with glycerin, soap or spit (never oil). 
  
1.  Into the stopper with two holes, insert the thermometer far enough so that
when the stopper is put into the Erlenmeyer Flask, it almost touches the
bottom 
of the flask (but do not allow it to touch it), and then insert one end of the
glass elbow far enough the stopper that is sticks out 1/4" to 1/2". 
  Into the six one-hole stpppers, insert a piece of the 8mm I.D. glass (or 
plastic) tubing so that 1/2" to 3/4" protrudes from the narrow end of the 
stopper. 
  
3.  Now select your setup space so that there is 1.5 feet of space clear 
in all directions around the Hotplate,  and then so that the three scrubber 
pipes can lie side by side where they will not be knocked over. 
  
4.  Take an approximately 2 foot piece of the 3/8" flexible tubing and connect
one end to the glass elow in the two-hole stopper, and the other end to the 
middle of one of the 8mm I.D. glass (or hard plastic) "T"'s. 
  
5.  With short pieces (select lengths for a neat fit) of 3/8" tubing and 
another 8mm "T" assemble the INLET SET manifold and connect to the bottom end 
of the scrubbers.  (Stoppers may then be inserted into the lower end of the 
scrubber pipes). 
  
6.  Elevate the OUT end of the scrubber pipes, so that the upper end is 6" to 
8" above the inlet end <BUT NO MORE>, and then fill the pipeswith water until
they are full within 4" to 8" of the top (outlet) end, and insert the outlet 
stoppers.  [Try to get all three scrlubbers EQUALLY full.] 
  
7.  With short pieces of 3/8" tubing and two 8mm I.D. "T"'s, prepare, and 
connect the OUTLET SET manifold to the scrubbers in a similar manner to the
way the set was connected in step 5. above. 
  
8.  To the last "T" of the OUTLET SET (of "T"'s manifold), connect a fairly 
long piece of 3/8" tubing  to reach a "safe" location (where connection nd 
disconnection of the reciever "bags" will not disturb the scrubbers) and
secure it.  Then put the last piece of 8mm I.D. hard tubing into the free end. 
  
9.  Finally, prepare several "Reciever Bags" by inserting about an 8" piece of
tubing into the top so that 3" or 4" sticks out of the "Bag" and secure it in 
place with a rubber band.

Generator. 
  
OPERATION:- 
  
     First, prepare a quantity of a mixture containing 1/3 sand and 2/3 
ammonium nitrate.  Then pour enough of the mixture into the erlenmeyer flask
to give 1.5" to 2" in the bottom of the flask.  Put the flask onto the Hotplate, 
and insert the two-hole stopper, firmly but not too tight.  <<THIS STOPPER IS 
YOUR SAFETY VALVE WHILE THE SYSTEM IS OPERATING>>.  - - - B-U-T - - -

     W                                                                     W 
     A Once the heating of the mixture in the erlenmeyer flask has started A 
     R you must REMOVE THE two-hole STOPPER FROM THE FLASK BEFORE TURNING  R 
     N OFF THE HEAT.  Otherwise as the flask starts to cool off, it will   N 
     I draw water from the scrubbers back into the hot flask and may crack I 
     N or EXPLODE the erlenmeyer flask with the STEAM formed inside.       N 
     G                                                                     G 
     WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING 
  
     Now you may begin heating the flask.  Turn the Hotplate to Medium or Med-
High and watch the thermometer.  (If the temperature climbs very fast, turn the 
Hotplate down, but be patient about turning it up.  Occasional bubbles will be
noted going through the scrubbers as the air in the system expands.  At 210C 
(410F) a yellowish to orange-brown mist will begin filling the flask, and the 
bubbling through the scrubbers will become steady. 
  
     At this time, adjust the upper end heights of the scrubber tubes so that 
each one gets about the same amount of gas passing through it.  Keep your eye 
on the temperature, and it should not climb much over the 210-220C (410-430F) 
marks.  Also the gas at the top of the scrubbers MUST BE PERFECTLY COLORLESS. 
Otherwise, turn down the heat setting.  If the gas flow is to low to give a 
steady flow through all three scrubbers, increase the heat slightly. 
  
     Once you've run your system a time or two, you'll know what your operating 
settings are. 
  
     As soon as the gas flow is steady and clean, connect a recieving bag to 
the final outlet tube, and allow the bag to fill.  It may be necessary to  add
more ammonium nitrate-sand mixture to the flask from time to time -- Wear 
Gloves as the flask will be HOT  when removing the stopper.  It is also a good
idea to turn off the Hotplate while the stopper is out of the flask. 
  
  
     ONCE YOU'VE FILLED A FEW BAGS WITH LAUGHING GAS, YOU'RE READY TO TRY
SOME. JUST INHALE  FROM THE BAG AND HOLD IT IN AS LONG AS YOU CAN.  YOU'LL KNOW
WHAT TO DO FROM THERE.
