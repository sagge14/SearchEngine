                    CHECKLIST FOR SAFER DRUG USE

       Tell your doctor about any drug you take (even aspirin, 
       allergy pills, laxatives, vitamins, etc.) before you take any 
       new drug.
       
       Learn all you can about drugs you may take before you take 
       them.  Information sources are your doctor, your nurse, your 
       pharmacist, books in your public library and this file.
       
       Don't take drugs prescribed for someone else--even if your 
       symptoms are the same.
       
       Keep your prescription drugs to yourself.  Your drugs may be 
       harmful to someone else.
       
       Tell your doctor about any symptoms you believe are caused by 
       a drug--prescription or non-prescription--that you take.
       
       Take only medicines that are necessary.  Avoid taking 
       non-prescription drugs while taking prescription drugs for a 
       medical problem.
       
       Before your doctor prescribes for you, tell him about your
       previous experiences with any drug--beneficial results, 
       adverse reactions or allergies.
       
       Take medicine in good light after you have identified it.  If 
       you wear glasses to read, put them on to check drug labels. 
       It is easy to take the wrong drug at the wrong time.
        
       Don't keep any drugs that change mood, alertness or 
       judgment--such as sedatives, narcotics or tranquilizers--by 
       your bedside.  These cause many accidental deaths by overdose. 
       You may unknowingly repeat a dose when you are half asleep or 
       confused.
       
       Know the names of your medicines.  These include the generic 
       name, the brand name and the generic names of all ingredients 
       in a drug mixture.  Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist can give 
       you this information.
       
       Study the labels on all non-prescription drugs.  If the 
       information is incomplete or if you have questions, ask the 
       pharmacist for more details.
       
       If you must deviate from your prescribed dose schedule, tell 
       your doctor.
       
       Shake liquid medicines before taking.

             child.

             agitation, rage or "hangover" effect.
             
           Pregnancy:
             Risk to unborn child outweighs drug benefits.  Don't 
             use.
             
           Breast-feeding:
             Drug passes into milk.  Avoid drug or discontinue

           Others:
             Hot weather, heavy exercise and profuse sweat may reduce 
             excretion and cause overdose.
             
             "Hangover" effect may occur.

           Before you start, consult your doctor:
             If you have had liver, kidney or heart trouble.
             
             If you are prone to stomach upsets (if medicine is in 
             oral form).
             
             If you have colitis or a rectal inflammation (if 
             medicine is in suppository form).
             
           Over age 60:
             Adverse reactions and side effects may be more frequent 
             and severe than in younger persons.  More likely to have 
             "hangover" effect.

             medicine affects you.  Don't work around dangerous 
             machinery.  Don't climb ladders or work in high places. 
             Danger increases if you drink alcohol or take medicine 
             affecting alertness and reflexes, such as 
             antihistamines, tranquilizers, sedatives, pain 
             medicine, narcotics and mind-altering drugs.
             
           Discontinuing:
             Don't discontinue without consulting doctor.  Dose may 
             require gradual reduction if you have taken drug for a 
             long time.  Doses of other drugs may also require 
             adjustment.
