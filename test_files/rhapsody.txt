                            Is this the real life?
                             Is this just fantasy
                           Caught with my pants down
                          With no escape from reality

                                Open you thighs
                         Look up to the skies and feel
                              I'm just a gay boy
                            Play with your sexy toy
                        You can ease it in, Ease it out
                           Do not stop until I shout
                          Put it where the wind blows
                         You can stick it right up me
                              For Free, for free

                            Mama, just killed a man
                          I was giving him some head
                         Hes got aids and now hes Dead
                          Mama, stuck it in his mouth
                    And now hes gone and blown it all away
                                Mama, ooh-oooh
                          Didn't mean to make you cry
                  If I've not come again this time tommorrow
                Carry on, Carry on, until my arse is shattered

                           Too late, you had my Bum
                           Sent shivers up my spine
                          Bottom aching all the time
                   Goodbye everybody, I've got AIDS you know
                 I was taken from behind, Nearly made me blind

                      I see a pair of stilettoes on a man
                Have a go, Have a go, You can do the Gang Bango
                          Thunderbolts and Lightening
                 You can stick it tight in meeeeee, in meeeeee

                              Gay e oh, Gay e oh
                              Gay e oh, Magnifico

                      I'm just a rent boy, nobody pays me
                     Hes just a gay boy from a gay family
                         Spare me a dildo for his tea

                Easy suck, easy blow, will you let me have a go

               So you think you can leave me and fuckup my life
                 If you do I shall go round and tell your wife
                            Oh Baby, I want it baby
                             Just got to get it in
                         Just stick it right in my ear

                    Nothing really matters, anyone can see
                My arse is in tatters, it was all done for free
                       Taken me where the dead go .....
