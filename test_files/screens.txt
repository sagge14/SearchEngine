       Another "drug-related" text file written by The Griffin.


Figured this one out mearly by pure fluke.  As I was writing the
"Power Hash Toker", I figured out how to make my own cheap screens.

MATERIALS NEEDED: 1 piece of "restaurant strength" tin foil or foil
                    wrap (the stuff you get at home is too thin to
                    work; you have to double it to make it strong
                    enough).
                  1 pin

Directions
----------
1. What you need to do is to insert the tin foil with your thumb
   into where you need to have the screen.  As soon as it's in
   place, gently prick holes into the tinfoil.

I know, a short file, but I didn't feel like entering 2 files in
one.  Anyways, enjoy this one!
