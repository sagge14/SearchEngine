                Strange Blood   (The Wolf Pack)
Leslie Fish
---------------------------------

Strange blood! in our veins, too late we understand
Strength and size and long allegience to the elfling band
Strange blood! for its gifts the price at last comes due
Strange lands and stranger duties has it brought us to.

Strange blood! and its gifts we gained from long ago
Shapechanger gave us this, for cause we'll never know
Strange blood! and its wisdom long since changed our track
Whereever it may lead us now, there is no turning back.

Strange blood! we are wolves, and we are something more
Now it brings us endless wand'ring, hunger, rage, and war
Strange blood! kept us fed and brought us help at need
Now it draws us by our bond to go where others heed,

Strange blood! no regrets; we would not turn aside
It brought us safely through the fire where all the others died
Strange blood! howl again, for now we know too well
Better a friend on paths unknown than be alone in hell.
