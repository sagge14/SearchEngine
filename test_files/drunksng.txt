                                    WE THREE DRUNKS
                                      By Lucillus
                            Dedicated to Bain the Polite, 
                                   Magnus the Subtle
                                  and Ursus the Fuzzy
                        (Sung to the tune of "We Three KIngs")

                                 CHORUS (All together)
                        Oh, oh, brew of wonder, brew of might,
                            We'll be drinking you all night
                          Let's pound another, O my brothers,
                        Why don't we drink some more and fight?


(All together)
We three drunks so glorious are
We have yet to pass up a bar,
Steady drinking dulls our thinking,
We're looking good so far.

(CHORUS)

(Bain)
Bain the bold is my given name
Politeness is the name of my game
Always caring always sharing
Aren't you so glad I came?

(CHORUS)

  (Magnus)
  Magnus I am called to my face
  Subtlety is my saving grace
  Always sneaking, never peeking, 
  Hey, man, get off my case!

  (CHORUS)

  (Ursus)
  Last and least, poor Ursus am I
  Never sure who did what or why
  Sober never, fuzzy forever
  At least that's my alibi!     

  (CHORUS)

  (All together)                        
  Now you know how cool are we three
  Aren't you just as jealous can be
  Truth we found it, now we drink it
  Excuse us, we have to pee.
